glooms so much of the remote life I know, and
hence glooms also this book of interpretations:
for pages of life must either be interpretative or

<h3>MORAG OF THE GLEN</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was a black hour for Archibald Campbell
of Gorromalt in Strathglas, and for his wife
and for Morag their second daughter, when
the word came that Muireall had the sorrow
of sorrows. What is pain, and is death a
thing to fear? But there is a sorrow that
no man can have and yet go free for evermore
of a shadow upon his brow: and there
is a sorrow that no woman can have and
keep the moonshine in her eyes. And when
a woman has this sorrow, it saves or mars
her: though, for sure, none of us may discern
just what that saving may be, or from whom
or what, or what may be that bitter or sweet
ruin. We are shaped as clay in the potter’s
hand: ancient wisdom, that we seldom learn
till the hand is mercifully still, and the vessel,
finished for good or evil, is broken.</p>

<p>It is a true saying that memory is like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sea-weed when the tide is in&mdash;but the tide
ebbs. Each frond, each thick spray, each
fillicaun or pulpy globe, lives lightly in the
wave: the green water is full of strange
rumour, of sea-magic and sea-music: the
hither flow and thither surge give continuity
and connection to what is fluid and dissolute.
But when the ebb is far gone, and the wrack
and the weed lie sickly in the light, there is
only one confused intertangled mass. For
most of us, memory is this tide-left strand:
though for each there are pools, or shallows
which even the ebb does not lick up in its
thirsty way depthward,&mdash;narrow overshadowed
channels to which we have the intangible
clues. But for me there will never be any
ebb-tide of memory, of one black hour, and
one black day.</p>

<p>A wild lone place it was where we lived:
among the wet hills, in a country capped by
slate-black mountains. To the stranger the
whole scene must have appeared grimly desolate.
We, dwellers there, and those of our
clan, and the hill folk about and beyond,
knew that there were three fertile straths
hidden among the wilderness of rock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
bracken: Strathmòr, Strathgorm, and Strathglas.
It was in the last we lived. All
Strathglas was farmed by Archibald Campbell,
and he had Strathgorm to where the
Gorromalt Water cuts it off from the head
of Glen Annet. The house we lived in
was a long two-storeyed whitewashed building
with projecting flanks. There was no garden,
but only a tangled potato-acre, and a large
unkempt space where the kail and the
bracken flourished side by side, with the kail
perishing day by day under the spreading
strangling roots of the usurper. The rain in
Strathglas fell when most other spots were
fair. It was because of the lie of the land,
I have heard. The grey or black cloud
would slip over Ben-Bhreac or Melbèinn,
and would become blue-black while one was
wondering if the wind would lift it on to
Maol-Dunn, whose gloomy ridge had two
thin lines of pine-trees which, from Strathglas,
stood out like bristling eyebrows. But,
more likely than not, it would lean slowly
earthward, then lurch like a water-logged
vessel, and spill, spill, through a rising misty
vapour, a dreary downfall. Oh! the rain&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rain&mdash;the rain! how weary I grew of it,
there; and of the melancholy <i>méh’ing</i> of the
sheep, that used to fill the hills with a lamentation,
terrible, at times, to endure.</p>

<p>And yet, I know, and that well, too, that
I am thinking this vision of Teenabrae, as
the house was called, and of its dismal vicinage,
in the light of tragic memory. For there
were seasons when the rains suspended, or
came and went like fugitive moist shadows:
days when the sunlight and the wind made
the mountains wonderful, and wrought the
wild barren hills to take on a softness and
a dear familiar beauty: hours, even, when,
in the hawthorn-time, the cuckoo called joyously
across the pine-girt scaurs and corries
on Melbèinn, or, in summer, the swallows
filled the straths as with the thridding of a
myriad shuttles.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I was too young to be there:
though, indeed, Morag was no more than a
year older, being twenty; but when my
mother died, and my father went upon the
seas upon one of his long whaling voyages,
I was glad to leave my lonely home in the
Carse o’ Gowrie and go to Teenabrae in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Strathglas, and to be with my aunt, that was
wife to Archibald mac Alasdair Ruadh&mdash;Archibald
Campbell, as he would be called
in the lowland way&mdash;or Gorromalt as he was
named by courtesy, that being the name of
his sheep-farm that ran into the two straths
where the Gorromalt Water surged turbulently
through a narrow wilderness of wave-scooped,
eddy-hollowed stones and ledges.</p>

<p>I suppose no place could be called lifeless
which had always that sound of Gorromalt
Water, that ceaseless lamentation of the
sheep crying among the hills, that hoarse
croaking of the corbies who swam black
in the air betwixt us and Maol-Dunn, that
mournful plaining of the lapwings as they
wheeled querulously for ever and ever and
ever. But, to a young girl, the whole of this
was an unspeakable weariness.</p>

<p>Beside the servant-folk&mdash;not one of whom
was to me anything, save a girl called Maisie,
who had had a child and believed it had
become a “pee-wit” since its death, and that
all the lapwings were the offspring of the
sorrow of joy&mdash;there were only Archibald
Campbell, his wife, who was my aunt, Muireall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the elder daughter, and Morag. These were
my folk: but Morag I loved. In appearance
she and I differed wholly. My cousin Muireall
and I were like each other; both tall, dark-haired,
dark-browed, with dusky dark eyes,
though mine with no flame in them;
and my face too, though not uncomely,
without that touch of wildness which made
Muireall’s so strangely attractive, and at times
so beautiful. Morag, however, was scarce
over medium height. Her thick wavy hair
always retained the captive gold that the sunshine
had spilled there; her soft, white,
delicate, wild-rose face was like none other
that I have ever seen: her eyes, of that heart-lifting
blue which spring mornings have, held
a living light that was fair to see, and gave
pain too, perhaps, because of their plaintive
hillside wildness. Ah, she was a fawn, Morag!…
soft and sweet, swift and dainty and
exquisite as a fawn in the green fern.</p>

<p>Gorromalt himself was a gaunt stern man.
He was two inches or more over six feet,
but looked less, because of a stoop. It always
seemed to me as if his eyes pulled him forward:
brooding, sombre, obscure eyes, of a murky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gloom. His hair was iron-grey and matted;
blacker, but matted and tangled, his thick beard;
and his face was furrowed like Ben Scorain of
the Corries. I never saw him in any other
garb than a grey shepherd tweed with a plaid,
though no Campbell in Argyll was prouder
than he, and he allowed no plaid or <i lang="gd">tunag</i>
anywhere on his land or in his house that
was not of the tartan of MacCailin Mòr. He
was what, there, they called a black protestant;
for the people in that part held to
the ancient faith. True enough, for sure, all
the same: for his pity was black, and the
milk of kindness in him must have been like
Gorromalt Water in spate. Poor Aunt Elspeth!
my heart often bled for her. I do not think
Archibald Campbell was unkind to his wife,
but he was harsh, and his sex was like a blank
wall to her, against which her shallow waters
surged or crawled alike vainly. There was
to her something at once terrible and Biblical
in this wall of cruel strength, this steadfast
independence of love or the soft ways or the
faltering speech of love. There are women
who hate men with an unknowing hatred,
who lie by their husband night after night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
year after year; who fear and serve him; who
tend him in life and minister to him in death;
who die, before or after, with a slaying thirst,
a consuming hunger. Of these unhappy
housemates, of desolate hearts and unfrequented
lips, my aunt Elspeth was one.</p>

<p>It was on a dull Sunday afternoon that the
dark hour came of which I have spoken. The
rain fell among the hills. There was none
on the north side of Strathglas, where Teenabrae
stood solitary. The remembrance is on
me keen just now: how I sat there, on the
bench in front of the house, side by side with
Morag, in the hot August damp, with the
gnats pinging overhead, and not a sound else
save the loud raucous surge of Gorromalt
Water, thirty yards away. In a chair near
us sat my aunt Elspeth. Beyond her, on a
milking-stool, with his chin in his hands, and
his elbows on his knees, was her husband.</p>

<p>There was a gloom upon all of us. The
day before, as soon as Gorromalt had returned
from Castle Avale, high up in Strathmòr, we
had seen the black east wind in his eyes.
But he had said nothing. We guessed that
his visit to the Englishman at Castle Avale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who had bought the Three Straths from Sir
Ewan Campbell of Drumdoon, had proved
fruitless, or at least unsatisfactory. It was at
the porridge on the Sabbath morning that
he told us.</p>

<p>“And … and … must we go,
Archibald?” asked his wife, her lips white
and the deep withered creases on her neck
ashy grey.</p>

<p>He did not answer, but the tumbler cracked
in his grip, and the splintered glass fell into
his plate. The spilt milk trickled off the
table on to the end of his plaid, and so to
the floor. Luath, the collie, slipped forward,
with her tongue lolling greedily: but her eye
caught the stare of the silent man, and with
a whine, and a sudden sweep of her tail, she
slunk back.</p>

<p>It must have been nigh an hour later, that
he spoke.</p>

<p>“No, Elspeth,” he said. “There will be no
going away from here, for you and me, till
we go feet foremost.”</p>

<p>Before the afternoon we had heard all: how
he had gone to see this English lord who
had “usurped” Drumdoon: how he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gained an interview, and had seen no other
than Mr Laing, the East Lothian factor. He
had had to accept bitter hard terms. Sir
Ewan Campbell was in Madras, with his
regiment, a ruined man: he would never be
home again, and, if he were, would be a
stranger in the Three Straths, where he and
his had lived, and where his kindred had
been born and had died during six centuries
back. There was no hope. This Lord
Greycourt wanted more rent, and he also
wanted Strathgorm for a deer-run.</p>

<p>We were sitting, brooding on these things:
in our ears the fierce words that Gorromalt
had said, with bitter curses, upon the selling
of the ancient land and the betrayal of the
people.</p>

<p>Morag was in one of her strange moods.
I saw her, with her shining eyes, looking at
the birch that overhung the small foaming
linn beyond us, just as though she saw the
soul of it, and the soul with strange speech
to it.</p>

<p>“Where is Muireall?” she said to me suddenly,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Muireall?” I repeated, “Muireall? I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not for knowing, Morag. Why do you ask?
Do you want her?”</p>

<p>She did not answer, but went on:</p>

<p>“Have you seen him again?”</p>

<p>“Him?… Whom?”</p>

<p>“Jasper Morgan, this English lord’s son.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>A long silence followed. Suddenly Aunt
Elspeth started. Pointing to a figure coming
from the peat-moss at the hither end of
Strathmòr, she asked who it was, as she could
not see without her spectacles. Her husband
rose, staring eagerly. He gave a grunt of
disappointment when he recognised Mr Allan
Stewart, the minister of Strathmòr parish.</p>

<p>As the old man drew near we watched him
steadfastly. I have the thought that each one
of us knew he was coming to tell us evil
news; though none guessed why or what,
unless Morag mayhap.</p>

<p>When he had shaken hands, and blessed
the house and those within it, Mr Stewart sat
down on the bench beside Morag and me.
I am thinking he wanted not to see the eyes
of Gorromalt, nor to see the white face of
Aunt Elspeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard him whisper to my dear that he
wanted her to go into the house for a little.
But she would not. The birdeen knew that
sorrow was upon us all. He saw “no” in
her eyes, and forbore.</p>

<p>“And what is the thing that is on your
lips to tell, Mr Stewart?” said Gorromalt
at last, half-mockingly, half-sullenly.</p>

<p>“And how are you for knowing that I have
anything to tell, Gorromalt?”</p>

<p>“Sure, man, if a kite can see the shadow
of a mouse a mile away, it can see a black
cloud on a hill near by!”</p>

<p>“It’s a black cloud I bring, Archibald
Campbell: alas, even so. Ay, sure, it is
a black cloud it is. God melt the pain
of it!”</p>

<p>“Speak, man!”</p>

<p>“There is no good in wading in heather.
Gorromalt, and you, Mrs Campbell, and you,
my poor Morag, and you too, my dear, must
just be brave. It is God’s will.”</p>

<p>“Speak, man, and don’t be winding the
shroud all the time! Let us be hearing and
seeing the thing you have brought to tell
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this moment that Aunt Elspeth
half rose, and abruptly reseated herself, raising
the while a deprecatory feeble hand.</p>

<p>“Is it about Muireall?” she asked quaveringly.
“She went away, to the church at
Kilbrennan, at sunrise: and the water’s in
spate all down Strathgorm. Has she been
drowned? Is it death upon Muireall? Is it
Muireall? Is it Muireall?”</p>

<p>“She is not drowned, Mrs Campbell.”</p>

<p>At that she sat back, the staring dread
subsiding from her eyes. But at the minister’s
words, Gorromalt slowly moved his face and
body so that he fronted the speaker. Looking
at Morag, I saw her face white as the canna.
Her eyes swam in wet shadow.</p>

<p>“It is not death, Mrs Campbell,” the old
man repeated, with a strange, uneasy, furtive
look, as he put his right hand to his stiff
white necktie and flutteringly fingered it.</p>

<p>“In the name o’ God, man, speak out!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, Campbell: ay, ay, I am speaking … I
am for the telling … but
… but, see you, Gorromalt, be pitiful
… be …”</p>

<p>Gorromalt rose. I never realised before how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tall he was. There was height to him, like
unto that of a son of Anak.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well, it is just for telling you
I’ll be. Sit down, Gorromalt, sit down, Mr
Campbell, sit down, man, sit down!…
Ah, sure now, that is better. Well, well,
God save us all from the sin that is in us:
but … ah, mothering heart, it is saving
you I would be if I could, but …
but …”</p>

<p>“But <em>what</em>!” thundered Gorromalt, with a
voice that brought Maisie and Kirsteen out of
the byre, where they were milking the kye.</p>

<p>“He has the mercy: He only! And it is
this, poor people: it is this. Muireall has
come to sorrow.”</p>

<p>“What sorrow is the sorrow that is on
her?”</p>

<p>“The sorrow of woman.”</p>

<p>A terrible oath leapt from Gorromalt’s lips.
His wife sat in a stony silence, her staring
eyes filming like those of a stricken bird.
Morag put her left hand to her heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly Archibald Campbell turned to his
daughter.</p>

<p>“Morag, what is the name of that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
whom Muireall came to know, when she and
you went to that Sodom, that Gomorrha,
which men call London?”</p>

<p>“His name was Jasper Morgan.”</p>

<p>“Has she ever seen him since?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“You <em>think</em>? What will you be <em>thinking</em>
for, girl! <em>Think!</em> There will be time enough
to think while the lichen grows grey on a
new-fall’n rock! Out with it! Out with it!
Have they met?… Has he been here?…
is <em>he</em> the man?”</p>

<p>There was silence then. A plover wheeled
by, plaining aimlessly. Maisie the milk-lass
ran forward, laughing.</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis my wee Seorsa,” she cried.
“Seorsa! Seorsa! Seorsa!”</p>

<p>Gorromalt took a stride forward, his face
shadowy with anger, his eyes ablaze.</p>

<p>“Get back to the kye, you wanton wench!”
he shouted savagely. “Get back, or it is
having my gun I’ll be and shooting that
pee-wit of yours, that lennavan-Seorsa!”</p>

<p>Then, shaking still, he turned to Morag.</p>

<p>“Out with it, girl! What do you know?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is a lie, and it is knowing it I am!”</p>

<p>“It is no lie. I <em>know</em> nothing. I <em>fear</em>
much.”</p>

<p>“And what do <em>you</em> know, old man?” And,
with that, Archibald Campbell turned like a
baited bull upon Mr Stewart.</p>

<p>“She was misled, Gorromalt, she was misled,
poor lass! The trouble began last May, when
she went away to the south, to that evil place.
And then he came after her. And it was
here he came … and … and…”</p>

<p>“And who will that man be?”</p>

<p>“Morag has said it: Jasper Morgan.”</p>

<p>“And who will Jasper Morgan be?”</p>

<p>“Are you not for knowing <em>that</em>, Archibald
Campbell, and you <em>Gorromalt</em>?”</p>

<p>“Why, what meaning are you at?” cried
the man, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Who will Jasper Morgan be but the son
of Stanley Morgan!”</p>

<p>“Stanley Morgan!… Stanley Morgan!
I am no wiser. Do you wish to send me
mad, man! Speak out!… out with it!”</p>

<p>“Why, Gorromalt, what is Drumdoon’s
name?”</p>

<p>“Drumdoon… Why, Sir Ewan… Ah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
no, for sure ’tis now that English bread-taker,
that southern land-snatcher, who calls himself
Lord Greycourt. And what then?… will
it be for…”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you for knowing his name?… No?… Campbell,
man, it is <em>Morgan</em> …
<em>Morgan</em>.”</p>

<p>All this time Aunt Elspeth had sat silent.
She now gave a low cry. Her husband
turned and looked at her. “Go into the
house,” he said harshly; “this will not be
the time for whimpering; no, by God! it is
not the time for whimpering, woman.”</p>

<p>She rose, and walked feebly over to Mr
Stewart.</p>

<p>“Tell me all,” she said. Ah, grief to see
the pain in her old, old eyes&mdash;and no tears
there at all, at all.</p>

<p>“When this man Jasper Morgan, that is
son to Lord Greycourt, came here, it was
to track a stricken doe. And now all is
over. There is this note only. It is for
Morag.”</p>

<p>Gorromalt leaned forward to take it. But
I had seen the wild look in Morag’s eyes,
and I snatched it from Mr Stewart, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
gave it to my dear, who slipped it beneath
her kerchief.</p>

<p>Sullenly her father drew up, scowled, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>“What else?” he asked, turning to the
minister.</p>

<p>“She is dying.”</p>

<p>“Dying!”</p>

<p>“Ay, alas, alas&mdash;the mist is on the hill&mdash;the
mist is on the hill&mdash;and she so young,
too, and so fair, ay, and so sweet and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do, Allan Stewart! That will
do!… It is dying she is, you are for telling
us! Well, well, now, and she the plaything
o’ Jasper Morgan, the son of the man there
at Drumdoon, the man who wants to drive
me away from here … this <em>new</em> man … this,
this lord … he … to drive <em>me</em> away,
who have the years and years to go upon,
ay, for more than six hundred weary long
years&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Muireall is dying, Archibald Campbell.
Will you be coming to see her, who is your
very own?”</p>

<p>“And for why is she dying?”</p>

<p>“She could not wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait! Wait! She could wait to shame
me and mine! No, no, no, Allan Stewart,
you go back to Lord Greycourt’s son and
his <i lang="gd">leannan</i>, and say that neither Gorromalt
nor any o’ Gorromalt’s kith or kin will have
aught to do with that wastrel-lass. Let her
death be on her! But it’s a soon easy death
it is!… she that slept here this very last
night, and away this morning across the moor
like a louping doe, before sunburst and an
hour to that!”</p>

<p>“She is at the ‘Argyll Arms’ in Kilbrennan.
She met the man there. An hour after he
had gone, they found her, lying on the deerskin
on the hearth, and she with the death-sickness
on her, and grave-white, because
of the poison there beside her. And now,
Archibald Campbell, it is not refusing you
will be to come to your own daughter, and
she with death upon her, and at the edge o’
the silence!”</p>

<p>But with that Gorromalt uttered wild, savage
words, and thrust the old man before him,
and bade him begone, and cursed Muireall,
and the child she bore within her, and the
man who had done this thing, and the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that had brought him into the world, latest
adder of an evil brood!</p>

<p>Scarce, however, was the minister gone, and
he muttering sore, and frowning darkly at that,
than Gorromalt reeled and fell.</p>

<p>The blood had risen to his brain, and he
had had a stroke. Sure, the sudden hand
of God is a terrifying thing. It was all we
could do, with the help of Maisie and Kirsteen,
to lift and drag him to his bed.</p>

<p>But an hour after that, when the danger
was over, I went to seek Morag. I could
find her nowhere. Maisie had seen her last.
I thought that she had taken one of the
horses from the stable, and ridden towards
Kilbrennan: but there was no sign of this.
On the long weary moor-road that led across
Strathglas to Strathgorm, she could not have
walked without being seen by some one at
Teenabrae. And everyone there was now
going to and fro, with whispers and a dreadful
awe.</p>

<p>So I turned and went down by the linn.
From there I could see three places where
Morag loved to lie and dream: and at one
of these I hoped to descry her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>And, sure, so it was. A glimpse I caught
of her, across the spray of the linn. She was
far up the brown Gorromalt Water, and
crouched under a rowan-tree.</p>

<p>When I reached her she looked up with a
start. Ah, the pain of those tear-wet May-blue
eyes&mdash;deep tarns of grief to me they
seemed.</p>

<p>In her hand she clasped the letter that I
had snatched for her.</p>

<p>“Read it, dear,” she said simply.</p>

<p>It was in pencil, and, strangely, was in the
Gaelic: strangely, for though, when with Mr
and Mrs Campbell, Morag and I spoke the
language we all loved, and that was our own,
Muireall rarely did. The letter ran somewhat
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Morag-à-ghraidh</span>,</p>

<p>“When you get this I shall not be your
living sister any more, but only a memory.
I take the little one with me. You know my
trouble. Forgive me. I have only one thing
to ask. The man has not only betrayed me,
he has lied to me about his love. He loves
another woman. And that woman, Morag, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
you: and you know it. He loved you first.
And now, Morag, I will tell you one thing
only. Do you remember the story that old
Sheen McIan told us&mdash;that about the twin
sisters of the mother of our mother&mdash;one that
was a Morag too?</p>

<p>“I am thinking you do: and here&mdash;where
I shall soon be lying dead, with that silence
within me, where such a wild clamouring voice
has been, though inaudible to other ears than
mine&mdash;<em>here, I am thinking you will be remembering,
and realising, that story</em>!</p>

<p>“If, Morag, <em>if</em> you do not remember&mdash;but
ah, no, we are of the old race of Siol
Dhiarmid, <em>and you will remember</em>!</p>

<p>“Tell no one of this, except F.&mdash;<em>at the end</em>.</p>

<p>“Morag, dear sister, till we meet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Muireall</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I do not understand, Morag-my-heart,”
I said. Even now, my hand shook because
of these words: “<em>and that woman, Morag, is
you: and you know it</em>.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” she answered, wearily. “I will
tell you to-night: but not now.”</p>

<p>And so we went back together; she, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
tired and stricken for tears, and I with so
many in my heart that there were none for
my hot eyes.</p>

<p>As we passed the byre we heard Kirsteen
finishing a milking song, but we stopped
when Maisie suddenly broke in, with her
strange, wild, haunting-sweet voice.</p>

<p>I felt Morag’s fingers tighten in their grasp
on my arm as we stood silent, with averted
eyes, listening to an old Gaelic ballad of
“Morag of the Glen.”</p>

<div class="container">

<h4>II</h4>

<p>That night the wind had a dreadful soughing
in its voice&mdash;a lamentable voice that came
along the rain-wet face of the hills, with a
prolonged moaning and sobbing.</p>

<p>Down in the big room, that was kitchen
and sitting-room in one, where Gorromalt
sat&mdash;for he had risen from his bed, for all
that he was so weak and giddy&mdash;there was
darkness. His wife had pleaded for the oil-lamp,
because the shadows within and the
wild wind without&mdash;though, I am thinking,
most the shadows within her brain&mdash;filled
her with dread; but he would not have it,
no, not a candle even. The peats glowed,
red-hot; above them the small narrow pine-logs
crackled in a scarlet and yellow blaze.</p>

<p>Hour after hour went by in silence. There
were but the three of us. Morag? Ah, did
Gorromalt think she would stay at Teenabrae,
and Muireall near by, and in the clutch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the death-frost, and she, her sister dear, not
go to her? He had put the ban upon us,
soon as the blood was out of his brain, and
he could half rise from his pillow. No one
was to go to see her, no one was to send
word to her, no one was to speak of her.</p>

<p>At that, Aunt Elspeth had fallen on her
knees beside the bed, and prayed to him to
show pity. The tears rained upon the relentless
heavy hand she held and kissed. “At
the least,” she moaned, “at the least, let some
one go to her, Archibald; at least a word,
only one word!”</p>

<p>“Not a word, woman, not a word. She has
sinned, but that’s the way o’ women o’ that
kind. Let her be. The wind’ll blow her
soul against God’s heavy hand, this very night
o’ the nights. It’s not for you nor for me.
But I’m saying this, I am: curse her, ay, curse
her again and again, for that she let the son
of the stranger, the son of our enemy, who
would drive us out of the home we have, the
home of our fathers, ay, back to the time
when no English foot ever trod the heather
of Argyll, that she would let him do her this
shame and disgrace, her and me, an’ you too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ay, and all of our blood, and the Strath too,
for that&mdash;ay, by God, and the clan, the whole
clan!”</p>

<p>But though Gorromalt’s word was law there,
there was one who had the tide coming in at
one ear and going out at the other. As soon
as the rainy gloom deepened into dark, she
slipped from the house; I wanted to go with
her, but she whispered to me to stay. It was
well I did. I was able to keep back from him,
all night, the story of Morag’s going. He
thought she was in her bed. So bitter on
the man was his wrath, that, ill as he was, he
would have risen, and ridden or driven over
to Kilbrennan, had he known Morag was
gone there.</p>

<p>Angus Macallum, Gorromalt’s chief man,
was with the horses in the stable. He tried
to prevent Morag taking out Gealcas, the
mare, she that went faster and surer than
any there. He even put hand upon the lass,
and said a rough word. But she laughed, I
am told; and I am thinking that whoever
heard Morag laugh, when she was “strange,”
for all that she was so white and soft, she
with her hair o’ sunlight, and the blue, blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
eyes o’ her!&mdash;whoever heard <em>that</em> would not
be for standing in her way.</p>

<p>So Angus had stood back, sullenly giving
no help, but no longer daring to interfere.
She mounted Gealcas, and rode away into the
dark rainy night where the wind went louping
to and fro among the crags on the braes
as though it were mad with fear or pain, and
complaining wild, wild&mdash;the lamentable cry
of the hills.</p>

<p>Hour after hour we sat there. We could
hear the roaring sound of Gorromalt Water
as it whirled itself over the linn. The stream
was in spate, and would be boiling black, with
livid clots of foam flung here and there on
the dripping heather overhanging the torrent.
The wind’s endless sough came into the house,
and wailed in the keyholes and the chinks.
Rory, the blind collie, lay on a mat near the
door, and the long hair of his felt was blown
upward, and this way and that, by the ground-draught.</p>

<p>Once or twice Aunt Elspeth rose, and stirred
the porridge that seethed and bubbled in the
pot. Her husband took no notice. He was
in a daze, and sat in his flanked leathern arm-chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with his arms laid along the sides, and
his down-clasping hands catching the red gleam
of the peats, and his face, white and set, like that
of a dead man looking out of a grated prison.</p>

<p>Once or twice, an hour or so before, when
she had begun to croon some hymn, he had
harshly checked her. But now when she
hummed, and at last openly sang the Gaelic
version of “The Lord’s my Shepherd,” he
paid no heed. He was not hearing that, or
anything she did. I could make nothing of
the cold bitterness that was on his face. He
brooded, I doubt not, upon doom for the
man, and the son of the man, who had wrought
him this evil.</p>

<p>His wife saw this, and so had her will at
last. She took down the great Gaelic Bible,
and read Christ’s words about little children.
The rain slashed against the window-panes.
Beyond, the wind moaned, and soughed, and
moaned. From the kennel behind the byre a
mournful howling rose and fell; but Gorromalt
did not stir.</p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth looked at me despairingly.
Poor old woman; ah, the misery and pain
of it, the weariness and long pain of starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
hearts and barren hopes. Suddenly an idea
came to her. She rose again, and went over
to the fire. Twice she passed in front of her
husband. He made no sign.</p>

<p>“He hates those things,” she muttered to
me, her eyes wet with pain, and with something
of shame, too, for admitting that she
believed in incantations. And why not, poor
old woman? Sure there are stranger things
than <i lang="gd">sian</i> or <i lang="gd">rosad</i>, charm or spell; and who
can say that the secret old wisdom is mere
foam o’ thought. “He hates those things, but
I am for saving my poor lass if I can. I
will be saying that old ancient <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, that is
called the <i lang="gd">Eolas an t-Snaithnean</i>.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Aunt Elspeth? What are
the three threads?”</p>

<p>“That <i lang="gd">eolas</i> killed the mother of my mother,
dearie; she that was a woman out of the
isle of Benbecula.”</p>

<p>“Killed her!” I repeated, awe-struck.</p>

<p>“Ay; ’tis a charm for the doing away of
bewitchment, and sure it is my poor Muireall
who has been bewitched. But my mother’s
mother used the <i lang="gd">eolas</i> for the taking away of
a curse upon a cow that would not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
milk. She was saying the incantation for
the third time, and winding the triple thread
round the beast’s tail, when in a moment all
the ill that was in the cow came forth and
settled upon her, so that she went back to
her house quaking and sick with the blight,
and died of it next day, because there was
no one to take it from her in turn by that
or any other <i lang="gd">eolas</i>.”</p>

<p>I listened in silence. The thing seemed
terrible to me then; no, no, not then only,
but now, too, whenever I think of it.</p>

<p>“Say it then, Aunt Elspeth,” I whispered;
“say it, in the name of the Holy Three.”</p>

<p>With that she went on her knees, and
leaned against her chair, though with her face
towards her husband, because of the fear that
was ever in her. Then in a low voice, choked
with sobs, she said this old <i lang="gd">eolas</i>, after she
had first uttered the holy words of the
“Pater Noster”:</p>

<p>Just as she finished, and as she was lingering
on the line, “<i lang="gd">Gu’m bi thusa, Muireall gu
math</i>” Rory, the blind collie, rose, whimpered,
and stood with snarling jaws.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Gorromalt heard this,
though his ears had been deaf to all else, or
so it seemed, at least.</p>

<p>“Down, Rory! down, beast!” he exclaimed,
in a voice strangely shrill and weak.</p>

<p>But the dog would not be still. His sullen
fear grew worse. Suddenly he sidled and lay
on his belly, now snarling, now howling, his
blind eyes distended, his nostrils quivering,
his flanks quaking. My uncle rose and stared
at the dog.</p>

<p>“What ails the beast?” he asked angrily,
looking now at Rory, now at us. “Has any
one come in? Has any one been at the
door?”</p>

<p>“No one, Archibald.”</p>

<p>“What have you been doing, Elspeth?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Woman, I heard your voice droning at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
your prayers. Ah, I see&mdash;you have been at
some of your <i lang="gd">sians</i> and <i lang="gd">eolais</i> again. Sure,
now, one would be thinking you would have
less foolishness, and you with the greyness
upon your years. What <i lang="gd">eolas</i> did she say,
lass?”</p>

<p>I told him. “Aw, silly woman that she is,
the <i lang="gd">eolas an t-Snaithnean</i>! madness and folly!…
Where is Morag?”</p>

<p>“In bed.” I said this with truth in my
eyes. God’s forgiveness for that good lie!</p>

<p>“And it’s time you were there also, and
you too, Elspeth. Come now, no more of
this foolishness. We have nothing to wait
for. Why are we waiting here?”</p>

<p>At that moment Rory became worse than
ever. I thought the poor blind beast would
take some dreadful fit. Foam was on his
jaws; his hair bristled. He had sidled forward,
and crouched low. We saw him look
again and again towards the blank space to
his right, as if, blind though he was, he saw
some one there, some one that gave him fear,
but no longer a fierce terror. Nay, more
than once we saw him swish his tail, and
sniff as though recognisingly. But when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
turned his head towards the door his sullen
fury grew, and terror shook upon every limb.
It was now that Gorromalt was speaking.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dog made a leap forward&mdash;a
terrible bristling wolf he seemed to me,
though no wolf had I ever seen, or imagined
any more fearsome, than Rory, now.</p>

<p>He dashed himself against the door, snarling
and mouthing, with his snout nosing the
narrow slip at the bottom.</p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth and I shook with fear. My
uncle was death-white, but stood strangely
brooding. He had his right elbow upon his
breast, and supported it with his left arm,
while with his right hand he plucked at his
beard.</p>

<p>“For sure,” he said at last, with an effort
to seem at ease; “for sure the dog is fëy
with his age and his blindness.” Then, more
slowly still, “And if that were not so, it
might look as though he had the fear on
him, because of some one who strove to
come in.”</p>

<p>“It is Muireall,” I whispered, scarce above
my breath.</p>

<p>“No,” said Aunt Elspeth, and the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her now was as though it had come out of
the granite all about us, cold and hard as
that. “No! Muireall is already in the room.”</p>

<p>We both turned and looked at her. She
sat quite still, on the chair betwixt the fire
and the table. Her face was rigid, ghastly,
but her eyes were large and wild.</p>

<p>A look first of fear, then almost of tenderness,
came into her husband’s face.</p>

<p>“Hush, Elspeth,” he said, “that is foolishness.”</p>

<p>“It is not foolishness, Archibald,” she resumed
in the same hard, unemotional voice,
but with a terrible intensity. “Man, man,
because ye are blind, is there no sight for
those who can see?”</p>

<p>“There is no one here but ourselves.”</p>

<p>But now Aunt Elspeth half rose, with supplicating
arms:</p>

<p>“Muireall! Muireall! Muireall! O muirnean,
muirnean!”</p>

<p>I saw Archibald Campbell shaking as
though he were a child and no strong man.
“Will you be telling us this, Elspeth,” he
began in a hoarse voice&mdash;“will you be telling
me this: if Muireall is in the room, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Rory there, who will be at the door? Who
is trying to come in at the door?”</p>

<p>“It’s a man. I do not know the man. It
is a man. It is Death, maybe. I do not
know the man. O muirnean, mo muirnean!”</p>

<p>But now the great gaunt black dog&mdash;terrible
in his seeing blindness he was to me&mdash;began
again his savage snarling, his bristling insensate
fury. He had ceased a moment while
our voices filled the room, and had sidled a
little way towards the place where Aunt
Elspeth saw Muireall, whining low as he
did so, and swishing his tail furtively along
the whitewashed flagstones.</p>

<p>I know not what awful thing would have
happened. It seemed to me that Death was
coming to all of us.</p>

<p>But at that moment we all heard the sound
of a galloping horse. There was a lull in the
wind, and the rain lashed no more like a
streaming whistling whip. Even Rory crouched
silent, his nostrils quivering, his curled snout
showing his fangs.</p>

<p>Gorromalt stood, listening intently.</p>

<p>“By the living God,” he exclaimed suddenly,
his eyes like a goaded bull’s&mdash;“I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
horse. Only one horse runs like that at the
gallop. ’Tis the grey stallion I sold three
months ago to the man at Drumdoon&mdash;ay,
ay, for the son of the man at Drumdoon!
A horse to ride for the shooting&mdash;a good
horse for the hills&mdash;that was what he wanted!
Ay, ay, by God, a horse for the son of the
man at Drumdoon! It’s the grey stallion:
no other horse in the Straths runs like that&mdash;d’ye
hear? d’ye hear? Elspeth, woman, is
there hearing upon you for <em>that</em>? Hey, <i>tlot-a-tlot,
tlot-a-tlot, tlot-tlot-tlot-tlot, tlot-a-tlot, tlot-tlot-tlot</i>!
I tell you, woman, it’s the grey stallion
I sold to Drumdoon: it’s that and no other!
Ay, by the Sorrow, it’s Drumdoon’s son that
will be riding here!”</p>

<p>By this time the horse was close by. We
heard his hoofs clang above the flagstones
round the well at the side of the house. Then
there was a noise as of scattered stones, and a
long scraping sound: then silence.</p>

<p>Gorromalt turned and put his hand to the
door. There was murder in his eyes, for all
the smile, a grim terrible smile, that had come
to his lips.</p>

<p>Aunt Elspeth rose and ran to him, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
him back. The door shook. Rory the hound
tore at the splinters at the base of the door,
his fell again bristling, his snarling savagery
horrible to hear. The pine-logs had fallen into
a smouldering ash. The room was full of
gloom, though the red sullen eye of the peat-glow
stared through the obscurity.</p>

<p>“Don’t be opening the door! Don’t be
opening the door!” she cried, in a thin screaming
voice.</p>

<p>“What for no, woman? Let me go! Hell
upon this dog&mdash;out o’ the way, Rory&mdash;get
back! Down wi’ ye!”</p>

<p>“No, no, Archibald! Wait! Wait!”</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>Rory ceased, sullenly listened, and then retreated,
but no longer snarling and bristling.</p>

<p>Gorromalt suddenly staggered.</p>

<p>“Who touched me just now?” he asked in
a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>“Who touched me just now? Who passed?
Who slid past me?” His voice rose almost
to a scream.</p>

<p>Then, shaking off his wife, he swung the
door open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no one there. Outside could be
heard a strange sniffling and whinnying. It
was the grey stallion.</p>

<p>Gorromalt strode across the threshold.
Scarcely had I time to prevent Aunt Elspeth
from falling against the lintel in a corner, yet
in a moment’s interval I saw that the stallion
was riderless.</p>

<p>“Archibald!” wailed his wife faintly out of her
weakness. “Archibald, come back! Come back!”</p>

<p>But there was no need to call. Archibald
Campbell was not the man to fly in the face
of God. He knew that no mortal rider rode
that horse to its death that night. Even before
he closed the door we heard the rapid, sliding,
catching gallop. The horse had gone: rider or
riderless I know not.</p>

<p>He was ashy-grey. Suddenly he had grown
quite still. He lifted his wife, and helped her
to her own big leathern arm-chair at the other
side of the ingle.</p>

<p>“Light the lamp, lass,” he said to me, in a
hushed strange voice. Then he stooped and
threw some small pine-logs on the peats, and
stirred the blaze till it caught the dry
splintered edges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Rory, poor blind beast, came wearily and
with a low whine to his side, and then lay
down before the warm blaze.</p>

<p>“Bring the Book,” he said to me.</p>

<p>I brought the great leather-bound Gaelic
Bible, and laid it on his knees.</p>

<p>He placed his hand in it, and opened at
random.</p>

<p>“With Himself be the word,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is it Peace?” asked Aunt Elspeth in a
tremulous whisper.</p>

<p>“It is Peace,” he answered, his voice gentle,
his face stern as a graven rock. And what
he read was this, where his eye chanced
upon as he opened at the place where is
the Book of the Vision of Nahum the
Elkoshite:</p>

<p>“<cite>What do ye imagine against the Lord? He
will make a full end.</cite>”</p>

<p>After that there was a silence. Then he
rose, and told me to go and lie down and
sleep; for, on the morrow, after dawn, I was
to go with him to where Muireall was.</p>

<p>I saw Aunt Elspeth rise and put her arms
about him. They had peace. I went to my
room, but after a brief while returned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sat, in the quietness there, by the glowing
peats, till dawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The greyness came at last; with it, the
rain ceased. The wind still soughed and
wailed among the corries and upon the
rocky braes; with low moans sighing along
the flanks of the near hills, and above the
stony watercourse where the Gorromalt surged
with swirling foam and loud and louder
tumult.</p>

<p>My eyes had closed in my weariness, when
I heard Rory give a low growl, followed by
a contented whimper. Almost at the same
moment the door opened. I looked up,
startled.</p>

<p>It was Morag.</p>

<p>She was so white, it is scarce to be wondered
at that I took her at first for a wraith.
Then I saw how drenched she was, chilled
to the bone too. She did not speak as I led
her in, and made her stand before the fire,
while I took off her soaked dress and shoes.
In silence she made all the necessary changes,
and in silence drank the tea I brewed for her.</p>

<p>“Come to my room with me,” she whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as with quiet feet we crossed the
stone flags and went up the wooden stair
that led to her room.</p>

<p>When she was in bed she bade me put
out the light and lie down beside her. Still
silent, we lay there in the darkness, for at
that side of the house the hill-gloom prevailed,
and moreover the blind was down-drawn.
I thought the weary moaning of the
wind would make my very heart sob.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Morag put her arms about
me, and the tears streamed warm about my
neck.</p>

<p>“Hush, Morag-aghray, hush, mo-rùn,” I
whispered in her ear. “Tell me what it is,
dear! Tell me what it is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, and I loved him so! I loved him!”</p>

<p>“I know it, dear; I knew it all along.”</p>

<p>I thought her sobs would never cease till
her heart was broken, so I questioned her
again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, gaspingly, “yes, I loved
him when Muireall and I were in the South
together. I met him a month or more before
ever she saw him. He loved me, and I promised
to marry him: but I would not go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
away with him as he wished: for he said
his father would never agree. And then he
was angry, and we quarrelled. And I&mdash;Oh!
I was glad too, for I did not wish to marry
an Englishman&mdash;or to live in a dreary city;
but … but … and then he and Muireall
met, and he gave all his thought to her; and
she her love to him.”</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>“Now?… <em>Now</em> Muireall is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead? O Morag, <em>dead</em>? Oh, poor Muireall
that we loved so! But did you see her? was
she alive when you reached her?”</p>

<p>“No; but she was alone. And now, listen.
Here is a thing I have to tell you. When
Ealasaid Cameron, that was my mother’s mother,
was a girl, she had a cruel sorrow. She had
two sisters whom she loved with all her heart.
They were twins, Silis and Morag. One day
an English officer at Fort William took Silis
away with him as his wife; but when her
child was heavy within her she discovered
that she was no wife, for the man was already
wedded to a woman in the South. She left
him that night. It was bitter weather, and
midwinter. She reached home through a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
snowdrift. It killed her; but before she died
she said to Morag, ‘He has killed me and
the child.’ And Morag understood. So it
was that before any wind of spring blew upon
that snow, the man was dead.”</p>

<p>When Morag stopped here, and said no
more, I did not at first realise what she
meant to tell me. Then it flashed upon me.</p>

<p>“O Morag, Morag!” I exclaimed, terrified.
“But, Morag, you do not … you will
not …”</p>

<p>“<em>Will</em> not?” she repeated, with a catch in
her voice.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she resumed suddenly after a long,
strained silence. “While I lay beside my
darling Muireall, weeping and moaning over
her, and she so fair, with such silence where
the laughter had always been, I heard the
door open. I looked up: it was Jasper
Morgan.</p>

<p>“‘You are too late,’ I said. I stared at
the man who had brought her, and me, this
sorrow. There was no light about him at
all, as I had always thought. He was only
a man as other men are, but with a cold
selfish heart and loveless eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘She sent for me to come back to her,’
he answered, though I saw his face grow
ashy-grey as he looked at Muireall and saw
that she was dead.</p>

<p>“‘She is dead, Jasper Morgan.’</p>

<p>“‘<em>Dead … Dead?</em>’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, dead. It is upon you, her death.
Her you have slain, as though with your
sword that you carry: her, and the child
she bore within her, and that was yours.’</p>

<p>“At that he bit his lip till the blood came.</p>

<p>“‘It is a lie,’ he cried. ‘It is a lie, Morag.
If she said that thing, she lied.’</p>

<p>“I laughed.</p>

<p>“‘Why do you laugh, Morag?’ he asked,
in a swift anger.</p>

<p>“Once more I laughed.</p>

<p>“‘Why do you laugh like that, girl?’</p>

<p>“But I did not answer. ‘Come,’ I said,
‘come with me. I have something to say to
you. You can do no good here now. She
has taken poison, because of the shame and
the sorrow.’</p>

<p>“‘Poison!’ he cried, in horror; and also,
I could see in the poor cowardly mind of
him, in a sudden sick fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“But when I rose to leave the room he
made ready to follow me. I kissed Muireall
for the last time. The man approached, as
though to do likewise. I lifted my riding-whip.
He bowed his head, with a deep flush
on his face, and came out behind me.</p>

<p>“I told the inn-folk that my father would
be over in the morning. Then I rode slowly
away. Jasper Morgan followed on his horse,
a grey stallion that Muireall and I had often
ridden, for he was from Teenabrae farm.</p>

<p>“When we left the village it was into a
deep darkness. The rain and the wind made
the way almost impassable at times. But at
last we came to the ford. The water was in
spate, and the rushing sound terrified my
horse. I dismounted, and fastened Gealcas
to a tree. The man did the same.</p>

<p>“‘What is it, Morag?’ he asked in a quiet
steady voice&mdash;‘Death?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Death.’</p>

<p>“Then he suddenly fell forward, and snatched
my hand, and begged me to forgive him, swearing
that he had loved me and me only, and
imploring me to believe him, to love him,
to … Ah, the <em>hound</em>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“But all I said was this:</p>

<p>“‘Jasper Morgan, soon or late I would kill
you, because of this cruel wrong you did to
her. But there is one way: best for <em>her</em> …
best for <em>me</em> … best for <em>you</em>.’</p>

<p>“‘What is that?’ he said hoarsely, though
I think he knew now. The roar of the
Gorromalt Water filled the night.</p>

<p>“‘There is one way. It is the only way …
Go!’</p>

<p>“He gave a deep quavering sigh. Then
without word he turned, and walked straight
into the darkness.”</p>

<p>Morag paused here. Then, in answer to my
frightened whisper, she added simply:</p>

<p>“They will find his body in the shallows,
down by Drumdoon. The spate will carry
it there.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After that we lay in silence. The rain had
begun to fall again, and slid with a soft
stealthy sound athwart the window. A dull
light grew indiscernibly into the room. Then
we heard someone move downstairs. In the
yard, Angus, the stableman, began to pump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
water. A cow lowed, and the cluttering of
hens was audible.</p>

<p>I moved gently from Morag’s side. As
I rose, Maisie passed beneath the window on
her way to the byre. As her wont was, poor
wild wildered lass, she was singing fitfully.
It was the same ballad again. But we heard
a single verse only.</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="verse">“For I have killed a man,” she said,</div>

<div class="verse">And now he sleepeth with the dead.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the voice was lost in the byre, and
in the sweet familiar lowing of the kine.
The new day was come.</p>

<p>This story is founded upon a

Ireland, too; for Mr Yeats tells
me that last summer he met an

claimed to be of the Sliochd-nan-Ron&mdash;an
ancestry, indeed, indicated
in the man’s name: Rooney.</p>

in “The Anointed Man”), I should
explain that the designation is, of
course, not a real name. At the
same time, I have actual warrant
for its use; for I knew a Uist
man who, in the bitterness of his
sorrow, after his wife’s death in
childbirth, named his son <i>Mulad</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> the gloom of sorrow: grief).</p>

<h3>THE DAN-NAN-RON</h3>

<p>When Anne Gillespie, that was my friend in
Eilanmore, left the island after the death of
her uncle, the old man Robert Achanna, it
was to go far west.</p>

<p>Among the men of the outer isles who for
three summers past had been at the fishing
off Eilanmore, there was one named Mànus
MacCodrum. He was a fine lad to see, but
though most of the fisher-folk of the Lewis
and North Uist are fair, either with reddish
hair and grey eyes or blue-eyed and yellow-haired,
he was of a brown skin with dark hair
and dusky brown eyes. He was, however, as
unlike to the dark Celts of Arran and the
Inner Hebrides as to the Northmen. He
came of his people, sure enough. All the
MacCodrums of North Uist had been brown-skinned
and brown-haired and brown-eyed;
and herein may have lain the reason why,
in bygone days, this small clan of Uist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was known throughout the Western Isles as
the <i lang="gd">Sliochd nan Ròn</i>, the offspring of the
Seals.</p>

<p>Not so tall as most of the North Uist
and Long Island men, Mànus MacCodrum
was of a fair height and supple and strong.
No man was a better fisherman than he, and
he was well-liked of his fellows, for all the
morose gloom that was upon him at times.
He had a voice as sweet as a woman’s when
he sang, and he sang often, and knew all the
old runes of the islands, from the Obb of
Harris to the Head of Mingulay. Often,
too, he chanted the beautiful <i lang="gd">orain spioradail</i>
of the Catholic priests and Christian Brothers
of South Uist and Barra, though where he
lived in North Uist he was the sole man
who adhered to the ancient faith.</p>

<p>It may have been because Anne was a
Catholic too, though, sure, the Achannas were
so also, notwithstanding that their forebears
and kindred in Galloway were Protestant (and
this because of old Robert Achanna’s love for
his wife, who was of the old Faith, so it is
said)&mdash;it may have been for this reason,
though I think her lover’s admiring eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
soft speech and sweet singing had more to do
with it, that she pledged her troth to Mànus.
It was a south wind for him, as the saying
is; for with her rippling brown hair and
soft grey eyes and cream-white skin, there
was no comelier lass in the Isles.</p>

<p>So when Achanna was laid to his long
rest, and there was none left upon Eilanmore
save only his three youngest sons, Mànus
MacCodrum sailed north-eastward across the
Minch to take home his bride. Of the four
eldest sons, Alison had left Eilanmore some
months before his father died, and sailed
westward, though no one knew whither, or
for what end, or for how long, and no word
had been brought from him, nor was he ever
seen again in the island, which had come to
be called Eilan-nan-Allmharachain, the Isle
of the Strangers. Allan and William had
been drowned in a wild gale in the Minch;
and Robert had died of the white fever, that
deadly wasting disease which is the scourge
of the Isles. Marcus was now “Eilanmore,”
and lived there with Gloom and Sheumais,
all three unmarried, though it was rumoured
among the neighbouring islanders that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
loved Marsail nic Ailpean,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in Eilean-Rona
of the Summer Isles, hard by the coast of
Sutherland.</p>

<p>When Mànus asked Anne to go with him
she agreed. The three brothers were ill-pleased
at this, for apart from their not
wishing their cousin to go so far away, they
did not want to lose her, as she not only
cooked for them and did all that a woman
does, including spinning and weaving, but
was most sweet and fair to see, and in the
long winter nights sang by the hour together,
while Gloom played strange wild airs upon
his <i lang="gd">feadan</i>, a kind of oaten-pipe or flute.</p>

<p>She loved him, I know; but there was this
reason also for her going, that she was afraid
of Gloom. Often upon the moor or on the
hill she turned and hastened home, because
she heard the lilt and fall of that <i lang="gd">feadan</i>.
It was an eerie thing to her, to be going
through the twilight when she thought the
three men were in the house smoking after
their supper, and suddenly to hear beyond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
coming towards her the shrill song of that
oaten flute playing “The Dance of the Dead,”
or “The Flow and Ebb,” or “The Shadow-Reel.”</p>

<p>That, sometimes at least, he knew she was
there was clear to her, because as she stole
rapidly through the tangled fern and gale she
would hear a mocking laugh follow her like
a leaping thing.</p>

<p>Mànus was not there on the night when
she told Marcus and his brothers that she
was going. He was in the haven on board
the <i>Luath</i>, with his two mates, he singing in
the moonshine as all three sat mending their
fishing gear.</p>

<p>After the supper was done, the three
brothers sat smoking and talking over an offer
that had been made about some Shetland
sheep. For a time Anne watched them in
silence. They were not like brothers, she
thought. Marcus, tall, broad-shouldered, with
yellow hair and strangely dark blue-black
eyes and black eyebrows; stern, with a
weary look on his sun-brown face. The light
from the peats glinted upon the tawny curve
of thick hair that trailed from his upper lip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for he had the <i lang="gd">caisean-feusag</i> of the Northmen.
Gloom, slighter of build, dark of hue
and hair, but with hairless face; with thin,
white, long-fingered hands, that had ever a
nervous motion as though they were tide-wrack.
There was always a frown on the
centre of his forehead, even when he smiled
with his thin lips and dusky, unbetraying
eyes. He looked what he was, the brain of
the Achannas. Not only did he have the
English as though native to that tongue,
but could and did read strange unnecessary
books. Moreover, he was the only son of
Robert Achanna to whom the old man had
imparted his store of learning; for Achanna
had been a schoolmaster in his youth in
Galloway, and he had intended Gloom for the
priesthood. His voice, too, was low and clear,
but cold as pale-green water running under
ice. As for Sheumais, he was more like
Marcus than Gloom, though not so fair. He
had the same brown hair and shadowy hazel
eyes, the same pale and smooth face, with
something of the same intent look which
characterised the long-time missing and probably
dead eldest brother, Alison. He, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was tall and gaunt. On Sheumais’ face there
was that indescribable, as to some of course
imperceptible, look which is indicated by the
phrase, “the dusk of the shadow,” though
few there are who know what they mean by
that, or, knowing, are fain to say.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without any word or reason
for it, Gloom turned and spoke to her.</p>

<p>“Well, Anne, and what is it?”</p>

<p>“I did not speak, Gloom.”</p>

<p>“True for you, <i lang="gd">mo cailinn</i>. But it’s about
to speak you were.”</p>

<p>“Well, and that is true. Marcus, and you
Gloom, and you Sheumais, I have that to tell
which you will not be altogether glad for
the hearing. ’Tis about … about … me
and … and Mànus.”</p>

<p>There was no reply at first. The three
brothers sat looking at her, like the kye at
a stranger on the moorland. There was a
deepening of the frown on Gloom’s brow, but
when Anne looked at him his eyes fell and
dwelt in the shadow at his feet. Then Marcus
spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Is it Mànus MacCodrum you will be
meaning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, sure.”</p>

<p>Again, silence. Gloom did not lift his eyes,
and Sheumais was now staring at the peats.
Marcus shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>“And what will Mànus MacCodrum be
wanting?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Marcus, you know well what I mean.
Why do you make this thing hard for me?
There is but one thing he would come here
wanting; and he has asked me if I will go
with him, and I have said yes. And if you
are not willing that he come again with the
minister, or that we go across to the kirk in
Berneray of Uist in the Sound of Harris,
then I will not stay under this roof another
night, but will go away from Eilanmore at
sunrise in the <i>Luath</i>, that is now in the haven.
And that is for the hearing and knowing,
Marcus and Gloom and Sheumais!”</p>

<p>Once more, silence followed her speaking.
It was broken in a strange way. Gloom
slipped his <i lang="gd">feadan</i> into his hands, and so to
his mouth. The clear cold notes of the flute
filled the flame-lit room. It was as though
white polar birds were drifting before the
coming of snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The notes slid into a wild remote air:
cold moonlight on the dark o’ the sea, it was.
It was the <i lang="gd">Dàn-nan-Ròn</i>.</p>

<p>Anne flushed, trembled, and then abruptly
rose. As she leaned on her clenched right
hand upon the table, the light of the peats
showed that her eyes were aflame.</p>

<p>“Why do you play <em>that</em>, Gloom Achanna?”</p>

<p>The man finished the bar, then blew into
the oaten pipe, before, just glancing at the
girl, he replied:</p>

<p>“And what harm will there be in <em>that</em>,
Anna-ban?”</p>

<p>“You know it is harm. That is the Dàn-nan-Ròn!”</p>

<p>“Ay; and what then, Anna-ban?”</p>

<p>“What then? Are you thinking I don’t
know what you mean by playing the Song
of the Seal?”</p>

<p>With an abrupt gesture Gloom put the
<i lang="gd">feadan</i> aside. As he did so, he rose.</p>

<p>“See here, Anne,” he began roughly&mdash;when
Marcus intervened.</p>

<p>“That will do just now, Gloom. Ann-à-ghraidh,
do you mean that you are going to
do this thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, sure.”</p>

<p>“Do you know why Gloom played the Dàn-nan-Ròn?”</p>

<p>“It was a cruel thing.”</p>

<p>“You know what is said in the isles about
… about … this or that man, who is
under <i lang="gd">gheasan</i>&mdash;who is spell-bound … and
… and … about the seals and …”</p>

<p>“Yes, Marcus, it is knowing it that I am:
‘<i lang="gd">Tha iad a’ cantuinn gur h-e daoine fo gheasan
a th’ anns no roin.</i>’”</p>

<p>“‘<cite>They say that seals</cite>,’” he repeated slowly;
“‘<cite>they say that seals are men under magic
spells.</cite>’ And have you ever pondered that
thing, Anne, my cousin?”</p>

<p>“I am knowing well what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Then you will know that the MacCodrums
of North Uist are called the Sliochd-nan-ròn?”</p>

<p>“I have heard.”</p>

<p>“And would you be for marrying a man
that is of the race of the beasts, and that
himself knows what <i lang="gd">geas</i> means, and may any
day go back to his people?”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, Marcus, sure it is making a mock
of me you are. Neither you nor any here
believes that foolish thing. How can a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
born of a woman be a seal, even though his
<i lang="gd">sinnsear</i> were the offspring of the sea-people,&mdash;which
is not a saying I am believing either,
though it may be: and not that it matters
much, whatever, about the far-back forebears.”</p>

<p>Marcus frowned darkly, and at first made no
response. At last he answered, speaking sullenly.</p>

<p>“You may be believing this or you may be
believing that, Anna-nic-Gilleasbuig, but two
things are as well known as that the east
wind brings the blight and the west wind
the rain. And one is this: that long ago a
Seal-man wedded a woman of North Uist,
and that he or his son was called Neil
MacCodrum; and that the sea-fever of the
seal was in the blood of his line ever after.
And this is the other: that twice within the
memory of living folk a MacCodrum has
taken upon himself the form of a seal, and
has so met his death&mdash;once Neil MacCodrum of
Ru’ Tormaid, and once Anndra MacCodrum of
Berneray in the Sound. There’s talk of others,
but these are known of us all. And you will
not be forgetting now that Neil-donn was the
grandfather, and that Anndra was the brother
of the father of Mànus MacCodrum?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not caring what you say, Marcus:
it is all foam of the sea.”</p>

<p>“There’s no foam without wind or tide, Anne.
An’ it’s a dark tide that will be bearing you
away to Uist; and a black wind that will be
blowing far away behind the East, the wind
that will be carrying his death-cry to your ears.”</p>

<p>The girl shuddered. The brave spirit in
her, however, did not quail.</p>

<p>“Well, so be it. To each his fate. But,
seal or no seal, I am going to wed Mànus
MacCodrum, who is a man as good as any
here, and a true man at that, and the man
I love, and that will be my man, God willing,
the praise be His!”</p>

<p>Again Gloom took up the <i lang="gd">feadan</i>, and sent
a few cold white notes floating through the
hot room, breaking suddenly into the wild
fantastic opening air of the Dàn-nan-Ròn.</p>

<p>With a low cry and passionate gesture Anne
sprang forward, snatched the oat-flute from his
grasp, and would have thrown it in the fire.
Marcus held her in an iron grip, however.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be minding Gloom, Anne,” he
said quietly, as he took the <i lang="gd">feadan</i> from her
hand, and handed it to his brother; “sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he’s only telling you in <em>his</em> way what I am
telling you in mine.”</p>

<p>She shook herself free, and moved to the
other side of the table. On the opposite wall
hung the dirk which had belonged to old
Achanna. This she unfastened. Holding it
in her right hand, she faced the three men.</p>

<p>“On the cross of the dirk I swear I will
be the woman of Mànus MacCodrum.”</p>

<p>The brothers made no response. They looked
at her fixedly.</p>

<p>“And by the cross of the dirk I swear that
if any man come between me and Mànus, this
dirk will be for his remembering in a certain
hour of the day of the days.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, she looked meaningly at
Gloom, whom she feared more than Marcus
or Sheumais.</p>

<p>“And by the cross of the dirk I swear that
if evil come to Mànus, this dirk will have
another sheath, and that will be my milkless
breast: and by that token I now throw the
old sheath in the fire.”</p>

<p>As she finished, she threw the sheath on
to the burning peats.</p>

<p>Gloom quietly lifted it, brushed off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sparks of flame as though they were dust, and
put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“And by the same token, Anne,” he said,
“your oaths will come to nought.”</p>

<p>Rising, he made a sign to his brothers to
follow. When they were outside he told
Sheumais to return, and to keep Anne within,
by peace if possible&mdash;by force if not. Briefly
they discussed their plans, and then separated.
While Sheumais went back, Marcus and Gloom
made their way to the haven.</p>

<p>Their black figures were visible in the
moonlight, but at first they were not noticed
by the men on board the <i>Luath</i>, for Mànus
was singing.</p>

<p>When the isleman stopped abruptly, one of
his companions asked him jokingly if his song
had brought a seal alongside, and bid him
beware lest it was a woman of the sea-people.</p>

<p>He gloomed morosely, but made no reply.
When the others listened, they heard the wild
strain of the Dàn-nan-Ròn stealing through
the moonshine. Staring against the shore,
they could discern the two brothers.</p>

<p>“What will be the meaning of that?” asked
one of the men uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“When a man comes instead of a woman,”
answered Mànus slowly, “the young corbies
are astir in the nest.”</p>

<p>So, it meant blood. Aulay MacNeill and
Donull MacDonull put down their gear, rose,
and stood waiting for what Mànus would
do.</p>

<p>“Ho, there!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Ho-ro!”</p>

<p>“What will you be wanting, Eilanmore?”</p>

<p>“We are wanting a word of you, Mànus
MacCodrum. Will you come ashore?”</p>

<p>“If you want a word of me, you can come
to me.”</p>

<p>“There is no boat here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send the <i lang="gd">bàta-beag</i>.”</p>

<p>When he had spoken, Mànus asked Donull,
the younger of his mates, a lad of seventeen,
to row to the shore.</p>

<p>“And bring back no more than one man,”
he added, “whether it be Eilanmore himself
or Gloom-mhic-Achanna.”</p>

<p>The rope of the small boat was unfastened,
and Donull rowed it swiftly through the moonshine.
The passing of a cloud dusked the
shore, but they saw him throw a rope for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
guiding of the boat alongside the ledge of
the landing-place; then the sudden darkening
obscured the vision. Donull must be talking,
they thought; for two or three minutes elapsed
without sign: but at last the boat put off again,
and with two figures only. Doubtless the lad
had had to argue against the coming of both
Marcus and Gloom.</p>

<p>This, in truth, was what Donull had done.
But while he was speaking, Marcus was staring
fixedly beyond him.</p>

<p>“Who is it that is there?” he asked; “there,
in the stern?”</p>

<p>“There is no one there.”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw the shadow of a man.”</p>

<p>“Then it was my shadow, Eilanmore.”</p>

<p>Achanna turned to his brother.</p>

<p>“I see a man’s death there in the boat.”</p>

<p>Gloom quailed for a moment, then laughed low.</p>

<p>“I see no death of a man sitting in the boat,
Marcus; but if I did, I am thinking it would
dance to the air of the Dàn-nan-Ròn, which is
more than the wraith of you or me would do.”</p>

<p>“It is not a wraith I was seeing, but the
death of a man.”</p>

<p>Gloom whispered, and his brother nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sullenly. The next moment a heavy muffler
was round Donull’s mouth, and before he
could resist, or even guess what had happened,
he was on his face on the shore, bound and
gagged. A minute later the oars were taken
by Gloom, and the boat moved swiftly out of
the inner haven.</p>

<p>As it drew near through the gloom Mànus
stared at it intently.</p>

<p>“That is not Donull that is rowing, Aulay!”</p>

<p>“No; it will be Gloom Achanna, I’m
thinking.”</p>

<p>MacCodrum started. If so, that other figure
at the stern was too big for Donull. The
cloud passed just as the boat came alongside.
The rope was made secure, and then Marcus
and Gloom sprang on board.</p>

<p>“Where is Donull MacDonull?” demanded
Mànus sharply.</p>

<p>Marcus made no reply, so Gloom answered
for him.</p>

<p>“He has gone up to the house with a message
to Anna-nic-Gilleasbuig.”</p>

<p>“And what will that message be?”</p>

<p>“That Mànus MacCodrum has sailed away
from Eilanmore, and will not see her again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>MacCodrum laughed. It was a low, ugly
laugh.</p>

<p>“Sure, Gloom Achanna, you should be taking
that <i lang="gd">feadan</i> of yours and playing the
Codhail-nan-Pairtean, for I’m thinkin’ the
crabs are gathering about the rocks down
below us, an’ laughing wi’ their claws.”</p>

<p>“Well, and that is a true thing,” Gloom replied,
slowly and quietly. “Yes, for sure I
might, as you say, be playing the Meeting
of the Crabs. Perhaps,” he added, as by a
sudden afterthought, “perhaps, though it is
a calm night, you will be hearing the <i lang="gd">comh-thonn</i>.
The ‘slapping of the waves’ is a
better thing to be hearing than the Meeting
of the Crabs.”</p>

<p>“If I hear the <i lang="gd">comh-thonn</i>, it is not in the
way you will be meaning, Gloom ’ic Achanna.
’Tis not the ‘up sail and goodbye’ they
will be saying, but ‘Home wi’ the Bride.’”</p>

<p>Here Marcus intervened.</p>

<p>“Let us be having no more words, Mànus
MacCodrum. The girl Anne is not for you.
Gloom is to be her man. So get you hence.
If you will be going quiet, it is quiet we will
be. If you have your feet on this thing, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
you will be having that too which I saw in
the boat.”</p>

<p>“And what was it you saw in the boat,
Achanna?”</p>

<p>“The death of a man.”</p>

<p>“So … And now” (this after a prolonged
silence, wherein the four men stood
facing each other), “is it a blood-matter, if not
of peace?”</p>

<p>“Ay. Go, if you are wise. If not, ’tis
your own death you will be making.”</p>

<p>There was a flash as of summer lightning.
A bluish flame seemed to leap through the
moonshine. Marcus reeled, with a gasping
cry; then, leaning back till his face blanched
in the moonlight, his knees gave way. As
he fell, he turned half round. The long knife
which Mànus had hurled at him had not
penetrated his breast more than two inches
at most, but as he fell on the deck it was
driven into him up to the hilt.</p>

<p>In the blank silence that followed, the three
men could hear a sound like the ebb-tide in
sea-weed. It was the gurgling of the bloody
froth in the lungs of the dead man.</p>

<p>The first to speak was his brother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
then only when thin reddish-white foam-bubbles
began to burst from the blue lips of Marcus.</p>

<p>“It is murder.”</p>

<p>He spoke low, but it was like the surf of
breakers in the ears of those who heard.</p>

<p>“You have said one part of a true word,
Gloom Achanna. It is murder … that you
and he came here for.”</p>

<p>“The death of Marcus Achanna is on you,
Mànus MacCodrum.”</p>

<p>“So be it, as between yourself and me, or
between all of your blood and me; though
Aulay MacNeill as well as you can witness
that, though in self-defence I threw the knife
at Achanna, it was his own doing that drove
it into him.”</p>

<p>“You can whisper that to the rope when it
is round your neck.”</p>

<p>“And what will <em>you</em> be doing now, Gloom-nic-Achanna?”</p>

<p>For the first time Gloom shifted uneasily.
A swift glance revealed to him the awkward
fact that the boat trailed behind the <i>Luath</i>,
so that he could not leap into it; while if he
turned to haul it close by the rope, he was
at the mercy of the two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will go in peace,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Ay,” was the answer, in an equally quiet
tone: “in the white peace.”</p>

<p>Upon this menace of death the two men
stood facing each other.</p>

<p>Achanna broke the silence at last.</p>

<p>“You’ll hear the Dàn-nan-Ròn the night
before you die, Mànus MacCodrum: and, lest
you doubt it, you’ll hear it again in your
death-hour.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Ma tha sìn an Dàn</i>&mdash;if that be ordained.”
Mànus spoke gravely. His very quietude,
however, boded ill. There was no hope of
clemency. Gloom knew that.</p>

<p>Suddenly he laughed scornfully. Then,
pointing with his right hand as if to someone
behind his two adversaries, he cried out: “Put
the death-hand on them, Marcus! Give them
the Grave!”</p>

<p>Both men sprang aside, the heart of each
nigh upon bursting. The death-touch of the
newly slain is an awful thing to incur, for it
means that the wraith can transfer all its evil
to the person touched.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a heavy splash.
In a second Mànus realised that it was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
more than a ruse, and that Gloom had escaped.
With feverish haste he hauled in the small
boat, leaped into it, and began at once to row
so as to intercept his enemy.</p>

<p>Achanna rose once, between him and the
<i>Luath</i>. MacCodrum crossed the oars in the
thole-pins, and seized the boat-hook.</p>

<p>The swimmer kept straight for him. Suddenly
he dived. In a flash, Mànus realised
that Gloom was going to rise under the boat,
seize the keel, and upset him, and thus
probably be able to grip him from above.
There was time and no more to leap: and,
indeed, scarce had he plunged into the sea
ere the boat swung right over, Achanna clambering
over it the next moment.</p>

<p>At first Gloom could not see where his foe
was. He crouched on the upturned craft, and
peered eagerly into the moonlit water. All at
once a black mass shot out of the shadow
between him and the smack. This black mass
laughed: the same low, ugly laugh that had
preceded the death of Marcus.</p>

<p>He who was in turn the swimmer was now
close. When a fathom away he leaned back
and began to tread water steadily. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
right hand he grasped the boat-hook. The
man in the boat knew that to stay where he
was meant certain death. He gathered himself
together like a crouching cat. Mànus kept
treading the water slowly, but with the hook
ready so that the sharp iron spike at the end
of it should transfix his foe if he came at him
with a leap. Now and again he laughed.
Then in his low sweet voice, but brokenly at
times, between his deep breathings, he began
to sing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>In the quiet moonlight the chant, with its
long slow cadences, sung as no other man in
the Isles could sing it, sounded sweet and
remote beyond words to tell. The glittering
shine was upon the water of the haven, and
moved in waving lines of fire along the stone
ledges. Sometimes a fish rose, and spilt a
ripple of pale gold; or a sea-nettle swam to
the surface, and turned its blue or greenish
globe of living jelly to the moon dazzle.</p>

<p>The man in the water made a sudden stop
in his treading, and listened intently. Then
once more the phosphorescent light gleamed
about his slow-moving shoulders. In a louder
chanting voice came once again,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, his quick ears had caught the inland
strain of a voice he knew. Soft and white as
the moonshine came Anne’s singing, as she
passed along the corrie leading to the haven.
In vain his travelling gaze sought her: she
was still in the shadow, and, besides, a slow
drifting cloud obscured the moonlight. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he looked back again, a stifled exclamation
came from his lips. There was not a sign of
Gloom Achanna. He had slipped noiselessly
from the boat, and was now either behind it, or
had dived beneath it, or was swimming under
water this way or that. If only the cloud
would sail by, muttered Mànus, as he held
himself in readiness for an attack from beneath
or behind. As the dusk lightened, he swam
slowly towards the boat, and then swiftly
round it. There was no one there. He
climbed on to the keel, and stood, leaning
forward as a salmon-leisterer by torchlight,
with his spear-pointed boat-hook raised.
Neither below nor beyond could he discern
any shape. A whispered call to Aulay MacNeill
showed that he, too, saw nothing. Gloom
must have swooned, and sank deep as he
slipped through the water. Perhaps the dogfish
were already darting about him.</p>

<p>Going behind the boat, Mànus guided it back
to the smack. It was not long before, with
MacNeill’s help, he righted the punt. One
oar had drifted out of sight, but as there
was a sculling hole in the stern, that did not
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“What shall we do with it?” he muttered,
as he stood at last by the corpse
of Marcus. “This is a bad night for us,
Aulay!”</p>

<p>“Bad it is; but let us be seeing it is not
worse. I’m thinking we should have left the
boat.”</p>

<p>“And for why that?”</p>

<p>“We could say that Marcus Achanna and
Gloom Achanna left us again, and that we
saw no more of them nor of our boat.”</p>

<p>MacCodrum pondered a while. The sound
of voices, borne faintly across the water,
decided him. Probably Anne and the lad
Donull were talking. He slipped into the
boat, and with a sail-knife soon ripped it here
and there. It filled, and then, heavy with
the weight of a great ballast-stone which
Aulay had first handed to his companion,
and surging with a foot-thrust from the latter,
it sank.</p>

<p>“We’ll hide the … the man there … behind
the windlass, below the spare sail, till
we’re out at sea, Aulay. Quick, give me a
hand!”</p>

<p>It did not take the two men long to lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the corpse and do as Mànus had suggested.
They had scarce accomplished this when
Anne’s voice came hailing silver-sweet across
the water.</p>

<p>With death-white face and shaking limbs
MacCodrum stood holding the mast, while
with a loud voice so firm and strong that Aulay
MacNeill smiled below his fear, he asked if
the Achannas were back yet, and, if so, for
Donull to row out at once, and she with him
if she would come.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-an-hour thereafter that
Anne rowed out towards the <i>Luath</i>. She had
gone at last along the shore to a creek where
one of Marcus’ boats was moored, and
returned with it. Having taken Donull on
board, she made way with all speed, fearful
lest Gloom or Marcus should intercept her.</p>

<p>It did not take long to explain how she
had laughed at Sheumais’ vain efforts to
detain her, and had come down to the haven.
As she approached, she heard Mànus singing,
and so had herself broken into a song she
knew he loved. Then, by the water-edge,
she had come upon Donull lying upon his
back, bound and gagged. After she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
released him, they waited to see what would
happen, but as in the moonlight they could
not see any small boat come in&mdash;bound to
or from the smack&mdash;she had hailed to know
if Mànus were there.</p>

<p>On his side, he said briefly that the two
Achannas had come to persuade him to leave
without her. On his refusal, they had departed
again, uttering threats against her as
well as himself. He heard their quarrelling
voices as they rowed into the gloom, but
could not see them at last because of the
obscured moonlight.</p>

<p>“And now, Ann-mochree,” he added, “is
it coming with me you are, and just as you
are? Sure, you’ll never repent it, and
you’ll have all you want that I can give.
Dear of my heart, say that you will be
coming away this night of the nights! By
the Black Stone on Icolmkill I swear it,
and by the Sun, and by the Moon, and by
Himself!”</p>

<p>“I am trusting you, Mànus dear. Sure,
it is not for me to be going back to that
house after what has been done and said. I
go with you, now and always, God save us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, dear lass o’ my heart, it’s farewell
to Eilanmore it is, for by the Blood on the
Cross I’ll never land on it again!”</p>

<p>“And that will be no sorrow to me, Mànus
my home!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this was the way that my friend Anne
Gillespie left Eilanmore to go to the isles of
the west.</p>

<p>It was a fair sailing in the white moonshine
with a whispering breeze astern. Anne
leaned against Mànus, dreaming her dream.
The lad Donull sat drowsing at the helm.
Forward, Aulay MacNeill, with his face set
against the moonshine to the west, brooded
dark.</p>

<p>Though no longer was land in sight, and
there was peace among the deeps of the quiet
stars and upon the sea, the shadow of fear
was upon the face of Mànus MacCodrum.</p>

<p>This might well have been because of the
as yet unburied dead that lay beneath the
spare sail by the windlass. The dead man,
however, did not affright him. What went
moaning in his heart, and sighing and calling
in his brain, was a faint falling echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he had heard as the <i>Luath</i> glided slow out
of the haven. Whether from the water or
from the shore he could not tell, but he heard
the wild fantastic air of the Dàn-nan-Ròn,
as he had heard it that very night upon the
<i lang="gd">feadan</i> of Gloom Achanna.</p>

<p>It was his hope that his ears had played him
false. When he glanced about him and saw
the sombre flame in the eyes of Aulay MacNeill,
staring at him out of the dusk, he knew
that which Oisìn, the son of Fionn, cried in
his pain: “his soul swam in mist.”</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>For all the evil omens, the marriage of Anne
and Mànus MacCodrum went well. He was
more silent than of yore, and men avoided
rather than sought him; but he was happy
with Anne, and content with his two mates,
who were now Callum MacCodrum and Ranald
MacRanald. The youth Donull had bettered
himself by joining a Skye skipper, who was
a kinsman; and Aulay MacNeill had surprised
everyone except Mànus by going away as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a seaman on board one of the <i>Loch</i> line of
ships which sail for Australia from the Clyde.</p>

<p>Anne never knew what had happened,
though it is possible she suspected somewhat.
All that was known to her was that Marcus
and Gloom Achanna had disappeared, and
were supposed to have been drowned. There
was now no Achanna upon Eilanmore, for
Sheumais had taken a horror of the place
and his loneliness. As soon as it was commonly
admitted that his two brothers must
have drifted out to sea, and been drowned, or
at best picked up by some ocean-going ship,
he disposed of the island-farm, and left Eilanmore
for ever. All this confirmed the thing
said among the islanders of the West&mdash;that
old Robert Achanna had brought a curse with
him. Blight and disaster had visited Eilanmore
over and over in the many years he
had held it, and death, sometimes tragic or
mysterious, had overtaken six of his seven
sons, while the youngest bore upon his brows
the “dusk of the shadow.” True, none knew
for certain that three out of the six were
dead, but few for a moment believed in the
possibility that Alison and Marcus and Gloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
were alive. On the night when Anne had left
the island with Mànus MacCodrum he, Sheumais,
had heard nothing to alarm him. Even
when, an hour after she had gone down to
the haven, neither she nor his brothers had
returned, and the <i>Luath</i> had put out to sea,
he was not in fear of any ill. Clearly, Marcus
and Gloom had gone away in the smack,
perhaps determined to see that the girl was
duly married by priest or minister. He would
have perturbed himself little for days to come,
but for a strange thing that happened that
night. He had returned to the house because
of a chill that was upon him, and convinced,
too, that all had sailed in the <i>Luath</i>. He
was sitting brooding by the peat-fire, when he
was startled by a sound at the window at the
back of the room. A few bars of a familiar
air struck painfully upon his ear, though played
so low that they were just audible. What
could it be but the Dàn-nan-Ròn; and who
would be playing that but Gloom? What
did it mean? Perhaps, after all, it was fantasy
only, and there was no <i lang="gd">feadan</i> out there in
the dark. He was pondering this when, still
low, but louder and sharper than before, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rose and fell the strain which he hated, and
Gloom never played before him, that of the
Davsa-na-mairv, the Dance of the Dead.
Swiftly and silently he rose and crossed the
room. In the dark shadows cast by the
byre he could see nothing; but the music
ceased. He went out, and searched everywhere,
but found no one. So he returned,
took down the Holy Book, and with awed
heart read slowly, till peace came upon him,
soft and sweet as the warmth of the peat-glow.</p>

<p>But as for Anne, she had never even this
hint that one of the supposed dead might be
alive; or that, being dead, Gloom might yet
touch a shadowy <i lang="gd">feadan</i> into a wild, remote
air of the Grave.</p>

<p>When month after month went by, and no
hint of ill came to break upon their peace,
Mànus grew light-hearted again. Once more
his songs were heard as he came back from
the fishing or loitered ashore mending his
nets. A new happiness was nigh to them,
for Anne was with child. True, there was
fear also, for the girl was not well at the
time when her labour was near, and grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
weaker daily. There came a day when Mànus
had to go to Loch Boisdale in South Uist; and
it was with pain, and something of foreboding,
that he sailed away from Berneray in the Sound
of Harris, where he lived. It was on the
third night that he returned. He was met by
Katreen MacRanald, the wife of his mate, with
the news that, on the morrow after his going,
Anne had sent for the priest, who was staying
at Loch Maddy, for she had felt the
coming of death. It was that very evening
she died, and took the child with her.</p>

<p>Mànus heard as one in a dream. It seemed
to him that the tide was ebbing in his heart,
and a cold sleety rain falling, falling through
a mist in his brain.</p>

<p>Sorrow lay heavily upon him. After the
earthing of her whom he loved he went to
and fro solitary; often crossing the Narrows
and going to the old Pictish Tower under
the shadow of Ben Breac. He would not go
upon the sea, but let his kinsman Callum do
as he liked with the <i>Luath</i>.</p>

<p>Now and again Father Allan MacNeill
sailed northward to see him. Each time he
departed sadder. “The man is going mad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I fear,” he said to Callum, the last time he
saw Mànus.</p>

<p>The long summer nights brought peace and
beauty to the isles. It was a great herring-year,
and the moon-fishing was unusually good.
All the Uist men who lived by the sea-harvest
were in their boats whenever they could. The
pollack, the dogfish, the otters, and the seals,
with flocks of sea-fowl beyond number, shared
in the common joy. Mànus MacCodrum alone
paid no need to herring or mackerel. He
was often seen striding along the shore, and
more than once had been heard laughing.
Sometimes, too, he was come upon at low
tide by the great Reef of Berneray, singing
wild strange runes and songs, or crouching
upon a rock and brooding dark.</p>

<p>The midsummer moon found no man on
Berneray except MacCodrum, the Reverend
Mr Black, the minister of the Free Kirk, and
an old man named Anndra McIan. On the
night before the last day of the middle month,
Anndra was reproved by the minister for
saying that he had seen a man rise out of
one of the graves in the kirkyard, and steal
down by the stone-dykes towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Balnahunnur-sa-mona,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where Mànus MacCodrum
lived.</p>

<p>“The dead do not rise and walk, Anndra.”</p>

<p>“That may be, maighstir; but it may have
been the Watcher of the Dead. Sure, it is
not three weeks since Padruic McAlistair was
laid beneath the green mound. He’ll be
wearying for another to take his place.”</p>

<p>“Hoots, man, that is an old superstition.
The dead do not rise and walk, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“It is right you may be, maighstir; but I
heard of this from my father, that was old
before you were young, and from his father
before him. When the last buried is weary
with being the Watcher of the Dead he goes
about from place to place till he sees man,
woman, or child with the death-shadow in the
eyes, and then he goes back to his grave and
lies down in peace, for his vigil it will be
over now.”</p>

<p>The minister laughed at the folly, and went
into his house to make ready for the Sacrament
that was to be on the morrow. Old
Anndra, however, was uneasy. After the porridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he went down through the gloaming to
Balnahunnur-sa-mona. He meant to go in
and warn Mànus MacCodrum. But when he
got to the west wall, and stood near the open
window, he heard Mànus speaking in a loud
voice, though he was alone in the room.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">B’ionganntach do ghràdh dhomhsa, a’ toirt
barrachd air gràdh nam ban!…</i>”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This Mànus cried in a voice quivering with
pain. Anndra stopped still, fearful to intrude,
fearful also, perhaps, to see someone there
beside MacCodrum whom eyes should not
see. Then the voice rose into a cry of
agony.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Aoram dhuit, ay an déigh dhomh fàs
aosda!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With that Anndra feared to stay. As he
passed the byre he started, for he thought he
saw the shadow of a man. When he looked
closer he could see nought, so went his way
trembling and sore troubled.</p>

<p>It was dusk when Mànus came out. He
saw that it was to be a cloudy night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
perhaps it was this that, after a brief while,
made him turn in his aimless walk and go
back to the house. He was sitting before
the flaming heart of the peats, brooding in
his pain, when, suddenly, he sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>Loud and clear, and close as though played
under the very window of the room, came
the cold white notes of an oaten flute. Ah,
too well he knew that wild fantastic air.
Who could it be but Gloom Achanna, playing
upon his <i lang="gd">feadan</i>; and what air of all
airs could that be but the Dàn-nan-Ròn?</p>

<p>Was it the dead man, standing there unseen
in the shadow of the grave? Was Marcus
beside him&mdash;Marcus with the knife still thrust
up to the hilt, and the lung-foam upon his
lips? Can the sea give up its dead? Can
there be strain of any <i lang="gd">feadan</i> that ever was
made of man&mdash;there in the Silence?</p>

<p>In vain Mànus MacCodrum tortured himself
thus. Too well he knew that he had
heard the Dàn-nan-Ròn, and that no other
than Gloom Achanna was the player.</p>

<p>Suddenly an access of fury wrought him to
madness. With an abrupt lilt the tune swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
into the Davsa-na-mairv, and thence, after a
few seconds, and in a moment, into that
mysterious and horrible <i lang="gd">Codhail-nan-Pairtean</i>
which none but Gloom played.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake now, nor as to
what was meant by the muttering, jerking air
of the “Gathering of the Crabs.”</p>

<p>With a savage cry Mànus snatched up a
long dirk from its place by the chimney, and
rushed out.</p>

<p>There was not the shadow of a sea-gull
even in front: so he sped round by the byre.
Neither was anything unusual discoverable
there.</p>

<p>“Sorrow upon me,” he cried; “man or
wraith, I will be putting it to the dirk!”</p>

<p>But there was no one; nothing; not a
sound.</p>

<p>Then, at last, with a listless droop of his
arms, MacCodrum turned and went into the
house again. He remembered what Gloom
Achanna had said: “<cite>You’ll hear the Dàn-nan-Ròn
the night before you die, Mànus
MacCodrum, and lest you doubt it, you’ll hear
it in your death-hour.</cite>”</p>

<p>He did not stir from the fire for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hours; then he rose, and went over to his
bed and lay down without undressing.</p>

<p>He did not sleep, but lay listening and
watching. The peats burned low, and at last
there was scarce a flicker along the floor.
Outside he could hear the wind moaning
upon the sea. By a strange rustling sound
he knew that the tide was ebbing across the
great reef that runs out from Berneray. By
midnight the clouds had gone. The moon
shone clear and full. When he heard the
clock strike in its worm-eaten, rickety case, he
sat up, and listened intently. He could hear
nothing. No shadow stirred. Surely if the
wraith of Gloom Achanna were waiting for
him it would make some sign, now, in the
dead of night.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Mànus rose, crossed the
room on tip-toe, and soundlessly opened the
door. The salt-wind blew fresh against his
face. The smell of the shore, of wet sea-wrack
and pungent gale, of foam and moving
water, came sweet to his nostrils. He heard
a skua calling from the rocky promontory.
From the slopes behind, the wail of a moon-restless
lapwing rose and fell mournfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Crouching, and with slow, stealthy step, he
stole round by the seaward wall. At the dyke
he stopped, and scrutinised it on each side.
He could see for several hundred yards, and
there was not even a sheltering sheep. Then,
soundlessly as ever, he crept close to the byre.
He put his ear to chink after chink; but not
a stir of a shadow even. As a shadow, himself,
he drifted lightly to the front, past the hay-rick:
then, with swift glances to right and
left, opened the door and entered. As he
did so, he stood as though frozen. Surely, he
thought, that was a sound as of a step, out
there by the hay-rick. A terror was at his
heart. In front, the darkness of the byre,
with God knows what dread thing awaiting
him: behind, a mysterious walker in the night,
swift to take him unawares. The trembling
that came upon him was nigh overmastering.
At last, with a great effort, he moved towards
the ledge, where he kept a candle. With
shaking hand he struck a light. The empty
byre looked ghostly and fearsome in the flickering
gloom. But there was no one, nothing.
He was about to turn, when a rat ran along
a loose hanging beam, and stared at him, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
at the yellow shine. He saw its black eyes
shining like peat-water in moonlight.</p>

<p>The creature was curious at first, then
indifferent. At least, it began to squeak, and
then make a swift scratching with its forepaws.
Once or twice came an answering
squeak: a faint rustling was audible here and
there among the straw.</p>

<p>With a sudden spring Mànus seized the
beast. Even in the second in which he raised
it to his mouth, and scrunched its back with
his strong teeth, it bit him severely. He let
his hands drop, and grope furtively in the
darkness. With stooping head he shook the
last breath out of the rat, holding it with his
front teeth, with back-curled lips. The next
moment he dropped the dead thing, trampled
upon it, and burst out laughing. There was
a scurrying of pattering feet, a rustling of
straw. Then silence again. A draught from the
door had caught the flame and extinguished
it. In the silence and darkness MacCodrum
stood, intent but no longer afraid. He laughed
again, because it was so easy to kill with the
teeth. The noise of his laughter seemed to
him to leap hither and thither like a shadowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ape. He could see it: a blackness within the
darkness. Once more he laughed. It amused
him to see the <em>thing</em> leaping about like that.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned, and walked out into
the moonlight. The lapwing was still circling
and wailing. He mocked it, with loud, shrill
<i>pēē-wēēty, pēē-wēēty, pēē-wēēt</i>. The bird swung
waywardly, alarmed: its abrupt cry, and
dancing flight, aroused its fellows. The air
was full of the lamentable crying of plovers.</p>

<p>A sough of the sea came inland. Mànus
inhaled its breath with a sigh of delight.
A passion for the running wave was upon
him. He yearned to feel green water break
against his breast. Thirst and hunger, too,
he felt at last, though he had known neither
all day. How cool and sweet, he thought,
would be a silver haddock, or even a brown-backed
liath, alive and gleaming wet with
the sea-water still bubbling in its gills. It
would writhe, just like the rat; but then
how he would throw his head back, and
toss the glittering thing up into the moonlight,
catch it on the downwhirl just as it
neared the wave on whose crest he was, and
then devour it with swift voracious gulps!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>With quick jerky steps he made his way
past the landward side of the small thatchroofed
cottage. He was about to enter,
when he noticed that the door, which he
had left ajar, was closed. He stole to the
window and glanced in.</p>

<p>A single thin, wavering moonbeam flickered
in the room. But the flame at the heart of
the peats had worked its way through the
ash, and there was now a dull glow,
though that was within the “smooring,” and
threw scarce more than a glimmer into the
room.</p>

<p>There was enough light, however, for Mànus
MacCodrum to see that a man sat on the
three-legged stool before the fire. His head
was bent, as though he were listening. The
face was away from the window. It was
his own wraith, of course&mdash;of that Mànus felt
convinced. What was it doing there? Perhaps
it had eaten the Holy Book, so that
it was beyond his putting a <i lang="gd">rosad</i> on it!
At the thought, he laughed loud. The
shadow-man leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>The next moment MacCodrum swung himself
on to the thatched roof, and clambered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from rope to rope, where these held down
the big stones which acted as dead-weight
for the thatch against the fury of tempests.
Stone after stone he tore from its fastenings,
and hurled to the ground over and beyond
the door. Then, with tearing hands, he
began to burrow an opening in the thatch.
All the time he whined like a beast.</p>

<p>He was glad the moon shone full upon
him. When he had made a big enough
hole, he would see the evil thing out of
the grave that sat in his room, and would
stone it to death.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became still. A cold sweat
broke out upon him. The <em>thing</em>, whether
his own wraith, or the spirit of his dead foe,
or Gloom Achanna himself, had begun to
play, low and slow, a wild air. No piercing
cold music like that of the <i lang="gd">feadan</i>! Too
well he knew it, and those cool white notes
that moved here and there in the darkness
like snowflakes. As for the air, though he
slept till Judgment Day and heard but a
note of it amidst all the clamour of heaven
and hell, sure he would scream because of
the Dàn-nan-Ròn!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dàn-nan-Ròn: the <i lang="gd">Roin</i>! the Seals!
Ah, what was he doing there, on the bitter-weary
land! Out there was the sea. Safe
would he be in the green waves.</p>

<p>With a leap he was on the ground. Seizing
a huge stone he hurled it through the
window. Then, laughing and screaming, he
fled towards the Great Reef, along whose
sides the ebb-tide gurgled and sobbed, with
glistering white foam.</p>

<p>He ceased screaming or laughing as he
heard the Dàn-nan-Ròn behind him, faint,
but following; sure, following. Bending low,
he raced towards the rock-ledges from which
ran the reef.</p>

<p>When at last he reached the extreme
ledge, he stopped abruptly. Out on the
reef he saw from ten to twenty seals, some
swimming to and fro, others clinging to the
reef, one or two making a curious barking
sound, with round heads lifted against the
moon. In one place there was a surge and
lashing of water. Two bulls were fighting
to the death.</p>

<p>With swift stealthy movements Mànus unclothed
himself. The damp had clotted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
leathern thongs of his boots, and he snarled
with curled lip as he tore at them. He shone
white in the moonshine, but was sheltered
from the sea by the ledge behind which he
crouched. “What did Gloom Achanna mean
by that,” he muttered savagely, as he heard
the nearing air change into the “Dance of
the Dead.” For a moment Mànus was a
man again. He was nigh upon turning to
face his foe, corpse or wraith or living body,
to spring at this thing which followed him,
and tear it with hands and teeth. Then,
once more, the hated Song of the Seal stole
mockingly through the night.</p>

<p>With a shiver he slipped into the dark
water. Then, with quick, powerful strokes,
he was in the moon-flood, and swimming
hard against it out by the leeside of the
reef.</p>

<p>So intent were the seals upon the fight
of the two great bulls that they did not
see the swimmer, or, if they did, took him
for one of their own people. A savage
snarling and barking and half-human crying
came from them. Mànus was almost within
reach of the nearest, when one of the combatants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sank dead, with torn throat. The
victor clambered on to the reef, and leaned
high, swaying its great head and shoulders
to and fro. In the moonlight its white
fangs were like red coral. Its blinded eyes
ran with gore.</p>

<p>There was a rush, a rapid leaping and
swirling, as Mànus surged in among the
seals, which were swimming round the place
where the slain bull had sunk.</p>

<p>The laughter of this long white seal
terrified them.</p>

<p>When his knee struck against a rock,
MacCodrum groped with his arms and hauled
himself out of the water.</p>

<p>From rock to rock and ledge to ledge
he went, with a fantastic dancing motion,
his body gleaming foam-white in the moonshine.</p>

<p>As he pranced and trampled along the
weedy ledges, he sang snatches of an old
rune&mdash;the lost rune of the MacCodrums of
Uist. The seals on the rocks crouched
spell-bound: those slow-swimming in the water
stared with brown unwinking eyes, with their
small ears strained against the sound:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">The bull-seal that was a man, Arà! Arà!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By this time he was close upon the great
black seal, which was still monotonously swaying
its gory head, with its sightless eyes rolling
this way and that. The sea-folk seemed
fascinated. None moved, even when the dancer
in the moonshine trampled upon them.</p>

<p>When he came within arm-reach he stopped.</p>

<p>“Are you the Ceann-Cinnidh?” he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“Are you the head of this clan of the sea-folk?”</p>

<p>The huge beast ceased its swaying. Its
curled lips moved from its fangs.</p>

<p>“Speak, Seal, if there’s no curse upon
you! Maybe, now, you’ll be Anndra himself,
the brother of my father! Speak!
<cite>H’st&mdash;are you hearing that music on the
shore!</cite> ’Tis the Dàn-nan-Ròn! Death o’
my soul, it’s the Dàn-nan-Ròn! Aha, ’tis
Gloom Achanna out of the Grave. Back,
beast, and let me move on!”</p>

<p>With that, seeing the great bull did not
move, he struck it full in the face with
clenched fist. There was a hoarse strangling
roar, and the seal champion was upon him
with lacerating fangs.</p>

<p>Mànus swayed this way and that. All
he could hear now was the snarling and
growling and choking cries of the maddened
seals. As he fell, they closed in upon him.
His screams wheeled through the night like
mad birds. With desperate fury he struggled
to free himself. The great bull pinned him
to the rock; a dozen others tore at his
white flesh, till his spouting blood made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
rocks scarlet in the white shine of the
moon.</p>

<p>For a few seconds he still fought savagely,
tearing with teeth and hands. Once, only, a
wild cry burst from his lips: when from the
shore end of the reef came loud and clear
the lilt of the rune of his fate.</p>

<p>The next moment he was dragged down
and swept from the reef into the sea. As
the torn and mangled body disappeared
from sight, it was amid a seething crowd of
leaping and struggling seals, their eyes wild
with affright and fury, their fangs red with
human gore.</p>

<p>And Gloom Achanna, turning upon the
reef, moved swiftly inland, playing low on
his <i lang="gd">feadan</i> as he went.</p>

<h3><i>NOTE</i></h3>

<p>It should be explained that the
sin-relinquishing superstition&mdash;a
superstition probably pre-Celtic,
perhaps of the remotest antiquity&mdash;hardly
exists to-day, or, if at
all, in its crudest guise. The
last time I heard of it, even in
a modified form, was not in the
west, but in a remote part of
the Aberdeenshire highlands. Then,
it was salt, not bread, that was put
on the breast of the dead: and
the salt was thrown away, nor
was any wayfarer called upon to
perform this or any other function.</p>

<p>A wet wind out of the south mazed and
mooned through the sea-mist that hung over
the Ross. In all the bays and creeks was
a continuous weary lapping of water. There
was no other sound anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus was it at daybreak: it was thus at
noon: thus was it now in the darkening of
the day. A confused thrusting and falling
of sounds through the silence betokened the
hour of the setting. Curlews wailed in the
mist: on the seething limpet-covered rocks
the skuas and terns screamed, or uttered
hoarse, rasping cries. Ever and again the
prolonged note of the oyster-catcher shrilled
against the air, as an echo flying blindly
along a blank wall of cliff. Out of weedy
places, wherein the tide sobbed with long,
gurgling moans, came at intervals the barking
of a seal.</p>

<p>Inland, by the hamlet of Contullich, there
is a reedy tarn called the Loch-a-chaoruinn.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
By the shores of this mournful water a man
moved. It was a slow, weary walk that of
the man Neil Ross. He had come from
Duninch, thirty miles to the eastward, and had
not rested foot, nor eaten, nor had word of
man or woman, since his going west an hour
after dawn.</p>

<p>At the bend of the loch nearest the clachan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he came upon an old woman carrying peat.
To his reiterated question as to where he
was, and if the tarn were Feur-Lochan above
Fionnaphort that is on the strait of Iona on
the west side of the Ross of Mull, she did
not at first make any answer. The rain
trickled down her withered brown face, over
which the thin grey locks hung limply. It
was only in the deep-set eyes that the flame
of life still glimmered, though that dimly.</p>

<p>The man had used the English when first
he spoke, but as though mechanically. Supposing
that he had not been understood, he
repeated his question in the Gaelic.</p>

<p>After a minute’s silence the old woman
answered him in the native tongue, but only
to put a question in return.</p>

<p>“I am thinking it is a long time since you
have been in Iona?”</p>

<p>The man stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>“And why is that, mother?” he asked, in
a weak voice hoarse with damp and fatigue;
“how is it you will be knowing that I have
been in Iona at all?”</p>

<p>“Because I knew your kith and kin there,
Neil Ross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have not been hearing that name, mother,
for many a long year. And as for the old
face o’ you, it is unbeknown to me.”</p>

<p>“I was at the naming of you, for all
that. Well do I remember the day that Silis
Macallum gave you birth; and I was at the
house on the croft of Ballyrona when Murtagh
Ross&mdash;that was your father&mdash;laughed. It was
an ill laughing that.”</p>

<p>“I am knowing it. The curse of God on
him!”</p>

<p>“’Tis not the first, nor the last, though the
grass is on his head three years agone now.”</p>

<p>“You that know who I am will be knowing
that I have no kith or kin now on
Iona?”</p>

<p>“Ay; they are all under grey stone or
running wave. Donald your brother, and
Murtagh your next brother, and little Silis,
and your mother Silis herself, and your two
brothers of your father, Angus and Ian
Macallum, and your father Murtagh Ross,
and his lawful childless wife, Dionaid, and
his sister Anna&mdash;one and all, they lie beneath
the green wave or in the brown mould.
It is said there is a curse upon all who live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
at Ballyrona. The owl builds now in the
rafters, and it is the big sea-rat that runs
across the fireless hearth.”</p>

<p>“It is there I am going.”</p>

<p>“The foolishness is on you, Neil Ross.”</p>

<p>“Now it is that I am knowing who you
are. It is old Sheen Macarthur I am speaking
to.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Tha mise</i> … it is I.”</p>

<p>“And you will be alone now, too, I am
thinking, Sheen?”</p>

<p>“I am alone. God took my three boys at
the one fishing ten years ago; and before
there was moonrise in the blackness of my
heart my man went. It was after the drowning
of Anndra that my croft was taken from
me. Then I crossed the Sound, and shared
with my widow sister Elsie McVurie: till <em>she</em>
went: and then the two cows had to go:
and I had no rent: and was old.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, the rain dribbled
from the sodden bracken and dripping loneroid.
Big tears rolled slowly down the deep
lines on the face of Sheen. Once there was
a sob in her throat, but she put her shaking
hand to it, and it was still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Neil Ross shifted from foot to foot. The
ooze in that marshy place squelched with
each restless movement he made. Beyond
them a plover wheeled, a blurred splatch
in the mist, crying its mournful cry over
and over and over.</p>

<p>It was a pitiful thing to hear: ah, bitter
loneliness, bitter patience of poor old women.
That he knew well. But he was too weary,
and his heart was nigh full of its own
burthen. The words could not come to his
lips. But at last he spoke.</p>

<p>“Tha mo chridhe goirt,” he said, with tears
in his voice, as he put his hand on her bent
shoulder; “my heart is sore.”</p>

<p>She put up her old face against his.</p>

<p>“’S tha e ruidhinn mo chridhe,” she whispered;
“it is touching my heart you are.”</p>

<p>After that they walked on slowly through
the dripping mist, each dumb and brooding
deep.</p>

<p>“Where will you be staying this night?”
asked Sheen suddenly, when they had traversed
a wide boggy stretch of land; adding,
as by an afterthought&mdash;“Ah, it is asking you
were if the tarn there were Feur-Lochan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
No; it is Loch-a-chaoruinn, and the clachan
that is near is Contullich.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Yonder: to the right.”</p>

<p>“And you are not going there?”</p>

<p>“No. I am going to the steading of
Andrew Blair. Maybe you are for knowing it?
It is called the Baile-na-Chlais-nambuidheag.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>“I do not remember. But it is remembering
a Blair I am. He was Adam, the son
of Adam, the son of Robert. He and my
father did many an ill deed together.”</p>

<p>“Ay, to the stones be it said. Sure, now,
there was, even till this weary day, no man
or woman who had a good word for Adam
Blair.”</p>

<p>“And why that … why till this day?”</p>

<p>“It is not yet the third hour since he went
into the silence.”</p>

<p>Neil Ross uttered a sound like a stifled
curse. For a time he trudged wearily on.</p>

<p>“Then I am too late,” he said at last, but
as though speaking to himself. “I had hoped
to see him face to face again, and curse him
between the eyes. It was he who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Murtagh Ross break his troth to my mother,
and marry that other woman, barren at that,
God be praised! And they say ill of him,
do they?”</p>

<p>“Ay, it is evil that is upon him. This
crime and that, God knows; and the shadow
of murder on his brow and in his eyes. Well,
well, ’tis ill to be speaking of a man in
corpse, and that near by. ’Tis Himself only
that knows, Neil Ross.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ay and maybe no. But where is
it that I can be sleeping this night, Sheen
Macarthur?”</p>

<p>“They will not be taking a stranger at the
farm this night of the nights, I am thinking.
There is no place else for seven miles yet,
when there is the clachan, before you will be
coming to Fionnaphort. There is the warm
byre, Neil, my man; or, if you can bide by
my peats, you may rest, and welcome, though
there is no bed for you, and no food either
save some of the porridge that is over.”</p>

<p>“And that will do well enough for me,
Sheen; and Himself bless you for it.”</p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>After old Sheen Macarthur had given the
wayfarer food&mdash;poor food at that, but welcome
to one nigh starved, and for the heartsome
way it was given, and because of the thanks
to God that was upon it before even spoon
was lifted&mdash;she told him a lie. It was the
good lie of tender love.</p>

<p>“Sure now, after all, Neil, my man,” she
said, “it is sleeping at the farm I ought to
be, for Maisie Macdonald, the wise woman,
will be sitting by the corpse, and there will
be none to keep her company. It is there
I must be going; and if I am weary, there is
a good bed for me just beyond the dead-board,
which I am not minding at all. So, if it is
tired you are sitting by the peats, lie down on
my bed there, and have the sleep; and God
be with you.”</p>

<p>With that she went, and soundlessly, for
Neil Ross was already asleep, where he sat
on an upturned <i lang="gd">claar</i>, with his elbows on his
knees, and his flame-lit face in his hands.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased; but the mist still
hung over the land, though in thin veils now,
and these slowly drifting seaward. Sheen
stepped wearily along the stony path that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
led from her bothy to the farm-house. She
stood still once, the fear upon her, for she
saw three or four blurred yellow gleams moving
beyond her, eastward, along the dyke.
She knew what they were&mdash;the corpse-lights
that on the night of death go between the
bier and the place of burial. More than once
she had seen them before the last hour, and
by that token had known the end to be near.</p>

<p>Good Catholic that she was, she crossed herself,
and took heart. Then, muttering</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">she went on her way fearlessly.</p>

<p>When she came to the White House, she
entered by the milk-shed that was between
the byre and the kitchen. At the end of it
was a paved place, with washing-tubs. At
one of these stood a girl that served in the
house,&mdash;an ignorant lass called Jessie McFall,
out of Oban. She was ignorant, indeed, not
to know that to wash clothes with a newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dead body near by was an ill thing to do.
Was it not a matter for the knowing that the
corpse could hear, and might rise up in the
night and clothe itself in a clean white shroud?</p>

<p>She was still speaking to the lassie when
Maisie Macdonald, the deid-watcher, opened
the door of the room behind the kitchen to
see who it was that was come. The two old
women nodded silently. It was not till Sheen
was in the closed room, midway in which
something covered with a sheet lay on a
board, that any word was spoken.</p>

<p>“Duit sìth mòr, Beann Macdonald.”</p>

<p>“And deep peace to you, too, Sheen; and
to him that is there.”</p>

<p>“Och, ochone, mise ’n diugh; ’tis a dark
hour this.”</p>

<p>“Ay; it is bad. Will you have been hearing
or seeing anything?”</p>

<p>“Well, as for that, I am thinking I saw
lights moving betwixt here and the green place
over there.”</p>

<p>“The corpse-lights?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is calling them that they are.”</p>

<p>“I <em>thought</em> they would be out. And I have
been hearing the noise of the planks&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
cracking of the boards, you know, that will
be used for the coffin to-morrow.”</p>

<p>A long silence followed. The old women
had seated themselves by the corpse, their
cloaks over their heads. The room was fireless,
and was lit only by a tall wax death-candle,
kept against the hour of the going.</p>

<p>At last Sheen began swaying slowly to and
fro, crooning low the while. “I would not be
for doing that, Sheen Macarthur,” said the deid-watcher
in a low voice, but meaningly; adding,
after a moment’s pause, “<em>The mice have all
left the house.</em>”</p>

<p>Sheen sat upright, a look half of terror half
of awe in her eyes.</p>

<p>“God save the sinful soul that is hiding,”
she whispered.</p>

<p>Well she knew what Maisie meant. If the
soul of the dead be a lost soul it knows its
doom. The house of death is the house of
sanctuary; but before the dawn that follows the
death-night the soul must go forth, whosoever
or whatsoever wait for it in the homeless,
shelterless plains of air around and beyond.
If it be well with the soul, it need have no
fear: if it be not ill with the soul, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
fare forth with surety; but if it be ill with
the soul, ill will the going be. Thus is it
that the spirit of an evil man cannot stay,
and yet dare not go; and so it strives to
hide itself in secret places anywhere, in dark
channels and blind walls; and the wise
creatures that live near man smell the terror,
and flee. Maisie repeated the saying of Sheen;
then, after a silence, added&mdash;</p>

<p>“Adam Blair will not lie in his grave for a
year and a day because of the sins that are
upon him; and it is knowing that, they are,
here. He will be the Watcher of the Dead
for a year and a day.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sure, there will be dark prints in the
dawn-dew over yonder.”</p>

<p>Once more the old women relapsed into
silence. Through the night there was a sighing
sound. It was not the sea, which was too
far off to be heard save in a day of storm.
The wind it was, that was dragging itself
across the sodden moors like a wounded thing,
moaning and sighing.</p>

<p>Out of sheer weariness, Sheen twice rocked
forward from her stool, heavy with sleep. At
last Maisie led her over to the niche-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
opposite, and laid her down there, and waited
till the deep furrows in the face relaxed somewhat,
and the thin breath laboured slow across
the fallen jaw.</p>

<p>“Poor old woman,” she muttered, heedless
of her own grey hairs and greyer years; “a
bitter, bad thing it is to be old, old and weary.
’Tis the sorrow, that. God keep the pain of it!”</p>

<p>As for herself, she did not sleep at all that
night, but sat between the living and the dead,
with her plaid shrouding her. Once, when
Sheen gave a low, terrified scream in her sleep,
she rose, and in a loud voice cried, “<em>Sheeach-ad!
Away with you!</em>” And with that she lifted
the shroud from the dead man, and took the
pennies off the eyelids, and lifted each lid;
then, staring into these filmed wells, muttered
an ancient incantation that would compel the
soul of Adam Blair to leave the spirit of Sheen
alone, and return to the cold corpse that was
its coffin till the wood was ready.</p>

<p>The dawn came at last. Sheen slept, and
Adam Blair slept a deeper sleep, and Maisie
stared out of her wan, weary eyes against the
red and stormy flares of light that came into
the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When, an hour after sunrise, Sheen Macarthur
reached her bothy, she found Neil Ross, heavy
with slumber, upon her bed. The fire was not
out, though no flame or spark was visible; but
she stooped and blew at the heart of the peats
till the redness came, and once it came it grew.
Having done this, she kneeled and said a rune
of the morning, and after that a prayer, and
then a prayer for the poor man Neil. She
could pray no more because of the tears. She
rose and put the meal and water into the pot
for the porridge to be ready against his awaking.
One of the hens that was there came and
pecked at her ragged skirt. “Poor beastie,”
she said. “Sure, that will just be the way
I am pulling at the white robe of the Mother
o’ God. ’Tis a bit meal for you, cluckie, and
for me a healing hand upon my tears. O, och,
ochone, the tears, the tears!”</p>

<p>It was not till the third hour after sunrise
of that bleak day in that winter of the winters,
that Neil Ross stirred and arose. He ate in
silence. Once he said that he smelt the snow
coming out of the north. Sheen said no word
at all.</p>

<p>After the porridge, he took his pipe, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
there was no tobacco. All that Sheen had
was the pipeful she kept against the gloom
of the Sabbath. It was her one solace in the
long weary week. She gave him this, and held
a burning peat to his mouth, and hungered
over the thin, rank smoke that curled upward.</p>

<p>It was within half-an-hour of noon that, after
an absence, she returned.</p>

<p>“Not between you and me, Neil Ross,” she
began abruptly, “but just for the asking, and
what is beyond. Is it any money you are
having upon you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then how will you be getting across to
Iona? It is seven long miles to Fionnaphort,
and bitter cold at that, and you will be
needing food, and then the ferry, the ferry
across the Sound, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I know.”</p>

<p>“What would you do for a silver piece, Neil,
my man?”</p>

<p>“You have none to give me, Sheen Macarthur;
and, if you had, it would not be
taking it I would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would you kiss a dead man for a crown-piece&mdash;a
crown-piece of five good shillings?”</p>

<p>Neil Ross stared. Then he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“It is Adam Blair you are meaning, woman!
God curse him in death now that he is no
longer in life!”</p>

<p>Then, shaking and trembling, he sat down
again, and brooded against the dull red glow
of the peats.</p>

<p>But, when he rose, in the last quarter before
noon, his face was white.</p>

<p>“The dead are dead, Sheen Macarthur. They
can know or do nothing. I will do it. It is
willed. Yes, I am going up to the house
there. And now I am going from here. God
Himself has my thanks to you, and my blessing
too. They will come back to you. It
is not forgetting you I will be. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Neil, son of the woman that was
my friend. A south wind to you! Go up by
the farm. In the front of the house you will
see what you will be seeing. Maisie Macdonald
will be there. She will tell you what’s for
the telling. There is no harm in it, sure: sure,
the dead are dead. It is praying for you I will
be, Neil Ross. Peace to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“And to you, Sheen.”</p>

<p>And with that the man went.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Neil Ross reached the byres of the
farm in the wide hollow, he saw two figures
standing as though awaiting him, but separate,
and unseen of the other. In front of the
house was a man he knew to be Andrew
Blair; behind the milk-shed was a woman he
guessed to be Maisie Macdonald.</p>

<p>It was the woman he came upon first.</p>

<p>“Are you the friend of Sheen Macarthur?”
she asked in a whisper, as she beckoned him
to the doorway.</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“I am knowing no names or anything. And
no one here will know you, I am thinking. So
do the thing and begone.”</p>

<p>“There is no harm to it?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“It will be a thing often done, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sure.”</p>

<p>“And the evil does not abide?”</p>

<p>“No. The … the … person … the person
takes them away, and …”</p>

<p>“<em>Them?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“For sure, man! Them … the sins of the
corpse. He takes them away; and are you for
thinking God would let the innocent suffer for
the guilty? No … the person … the Sin-Eater,
you know … takes them away on himself,
and one by one the air of heaven washes
them away till he, the Sin-Eater, is clean and
whole as before.”</p>

<p>“But if it is a man you hate … if it is a
corpse that is the corpse of one who has been
a curse and a foe … if …”</p>

<p>“<em>Sst!</em> Be still now with your foolishness.
It is only an idle saying, I am thinking. Do
it, and take the money and go. It will be
hell enough for Adam Blair, miser as he was,
if he is for knowing that five good shillings
of his money are to go to a passing tramp
because of an old, ancient silly tale.”</p>

<p>Neil Ross laughed low at that. It was for
pleasure to him.</p>

<p>“Hush wi’ ye! Andrew Blair is waiting
round there. Say that I have sent you round,
as I have neither bite nor bit to give.”</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, Neil walked slowly
round to the front of the house. A tall man
was there, gaunt and brown, with hairless face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and lank brown hair, but with eyes cold and
grey as the sea.</p>

<p>“Good day to you, an’ good faring. Will
you be passing this way to anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Health to you. I am a stranger here. It is
on my way to Iona I am. But I have the hunger
upon me. There is not a brown bit in my
pocket. I asked at the door there, near the byres.
The woman told me she could give me nothing&mdash;not
a penny even, worse luck,&mdash;nor, for that,
a drink of warm milk. ’Tis a sore land this.”</p>

<p>“You have the Gaelic of the Isles. Is it
from Iona you are?”</p>

<p>“It is from the Isles of the West I come.”</p>

<p>“From Tiree? … from Coll?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“From the Long Island … or from Uist …
or maybe from Benbecula?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, sure it is no matter to me. But
may I be asking your name?”</p>

<p>“Macallum.”</p>

<p>“Do you know there is a death here, Macallum?”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t, I would know it now, because
of what lies yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Mechanically Andrew Blair looked round.
As he knew, a rough bier was there, that was
made of a dead-board laid upon three milking-stools.
Beside it was a <i lang="gd">claar</i>, a small tub to
hold potatoes. On the bier was a corpse,
covered with a canvas sheeting that looked
like a sail.</p>

<p>“He was a worthy man, my father,” began
the son of the dead man, slowly; “but he had
his faults, like all of us. I might even be
saying that he had his sins, to the Stones be
it said. You will be knowing, Macallum, what
is thought among the folk … that a stranger,
passing by, may take away the sins of the
dead, and that, too, without any hurt whatever
… any hurt whatever.”</p>

<p>“Ay, sure.”</p>

<p>“And you will be knowing what is done?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“With the bread … and the water…?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“It is a small thing to do. It is a Christian
thing. I would be doing it myself, and that
gladly, but the … the … passer-by who …”</p>

<p>“It is talking of the Sin-Eater you are?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, for sure. The Sin-Eater as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
called&mdash;and a good Christian act it is, for all that
the ministers and the priests make a frowning at
it&mdash;the Sin-Eater must be a stranger. He must
be a stranger, and should know nothing of the
dead man&mdash;above all, bear him no grudge.”</p>

<p>At that Neil Ross’s eyes lightened for a
moment.</p>

<p>“And why that?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? I have heard this, and I
have heard that. If the Sin-Eater was hating
the dead man he could take the sins and
fling them into the sea, and they would be
changed into demons of the air that would
harry the flying soul till Judgment-Day.”</p>

<p>“And how would that thing be done?”</p>

<p>The man spoke with flashing eyes and
parted lips, the breath coming swift. Andrew
Blair looked at him suspiciously; and hesitated,
before, in a cold voice, he spoke again.</p>

<p>“That is all folly, I am thinking, Macallum.
Maybe it is all folly, the whole of it. But, see
here, I have no time to be talking with you. If
you will take the bread and the water you shall
have a good meal if you want it, and … and
… yes, look you, my man, I will be giving
you a shilling too, for luck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will have no meal in this house, Anndra-mhic-Adam;
nor will I do this thing unless
you will be giving me two silver half-crowns.
That is the sum I must have, or no other.”</p>

<p>“Two half-crowns! Why, man, for one half-crown …”</p>

<p>“Then be eating the sins o’ your father
yourself, Andrew Blair! It is going I am.”</p>

<p>“Stop, man! Stop, Macallum. See here:
I will be giving you what you ask.”</p>

<p>“So be it. Is the … Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Ay, come this way.”</p>

<p>With that the two men turned and moved
slowly towards the bier.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the house stood a man
and two women; farther in, a woman; and
at the window to the left, the serving-wench,
Jessie McFall, and two men of the farm. Of
those in the doorway, the man was Peter, the
half-witted youngest brother of Andrew Blair;
the taller and older woman was Catreen, the
widow of Adam, the second brother; and the
thin, slight woman, with staring eyes and
drooping mouth, was Muireall, the wife of
Andrew. The old woman behind these was
Maisie Macdonald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrew Blair stooped and took a saucer
out of the <i lang="gd">claar</i>. This he put upon the
covered breast of the corpse. He stooped
again, and brought forth a thick square piece
of new-made bread. That also he placed upon
the breast of the corpse. Then he stooped
again, and with that he emptied a spoonful
of salt alongside the bread.</p>

<p>“I must see the corpse,” said Neil Ross
simply.</p>

<p>“It is not needful, Macallum.”</p>

<p>“I must be seeing the corpse, I tell you&mdash;and
for that, too, the bread and the water
should be on the naked breast.”</p>

<p>“No, no, man; it …”</p>

<p>But here a voice, that of Maisie the wise
woman, came upon them, saying that the man
was right, and that the eating of the sins
should be done in that way and no other.</p>

<p>With an ill grace the son of the dead man
drew back the sheeting. Beneath it, the corpse
was in a clean white shirt, a death-gown long
ago prepared, that covered him from his neck
to his feet, and left only the dusky yellowish
face exposed.</p>

<p>While Andrew Blair unfastened the shirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and placed the saucer and the bread and the
salt on the breast, the man beside him stood
staring fixedly on the frozen features of the
corpse. The new laird had to speak to him
twice before he heard.</p>

<p>“I am ready. And you, now? What is it
you are muttering over against the lips of the
dead?”</p>

<p>“It is giving him a message I am. There
is no harm in that, sure?”</p>

<p>“Keep to your own folk, Macallum. You
are from the West you say, and we are from
the North. There can be no messages between
you and a Blair of Strathmore, no messages
for <em>you</em> to be giving.”</p>

<p>“He that lies here knows well the man to
whom I am sending a message”&mdash;and at this
response Andrew Blair scowled darkly. He
would fain have sent the man about his
business, but he feared he might get no other.</p>

<p>“It is thinking I am that you are not a
Macallum at all. I know all of that name in
Mull, Iona, Skye, and the near isles. What
will the name of your naming be, and of your
father, and of his place?”</p>

<p>Whether he really wanted an answer, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whether he sought only to divert the man
from his procrastination, his question had a
satisfactory result.</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s ready I am, Anndra-mhic-Adam.”</p>

<p>With that, Andrew Blair stooped once more
and from the <i lang="gd">claar</i> brought a small jug of
water. From this he filled the saucer.</p>

<p>“You know what to say and what to do,
Macallum.”</p>

<p>There was not one there who did not have
a shortened breath because of the mystery
that was now before them, and the fearfulness
of it. Neil Ross drew himself up, erect, stiff,
with white, drawn face. All who waited, save
Andrew Blair, thought that the moving of his
lips was because of the prayer that was
slipping upon them, like the last lapsing of
the ebb-tide. But Blair was watching him
closely, and knew that it was no prayer which
stole out against the blank air that was
around the dead.</p>

<p>Slowly Neil Ross extended his right arm.
He took a pinch of the salt and put it in the
saucer, then took another pinch and sprinkled
it upon the bread. His hand shook for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
moment as he touched the saucer. But there
was no shaking as he raised it towards his
lips, or when he held it before him when he
spoke.</p>

<p>“With this water that has salt in it, and
has lain on thy corpse, O Adam mhic Anndra
mhic Adam Mòr, I drink away all the evil
that is upon thee …”</p>

<p>There was throbbing silence while he paused.</p>

<p>“… And may it be upon me and not
upon thee, if with this water it cannot flow
away.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, he raised the saucer and passed
it thrice round the head of the corpse sun-ways;
and, having done this, lifted it to his
lips and drank as much as his mouth would
hold. Thereafter he poured the remnant over
his left hand, and let it trickle to the ground.
Then he took the piece of bread. Thrice, too,
he passed it round the head of the corpse
sun-ways.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at the man by his
side, then at the others, who watched him
with beating hearts.</p>

<p>With a loud clear voice he took the sins.</p>

<p>“<i>Thoir dhomh do ciontachd, O Adam mhic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Anndra mhic Adam Mòr!</i> Give me thy sins
to take away from thee! Lo, now, as I stand
here, I break this bread that has lain on thee
in corpse, and I am eating it, I am, and in
that eating I take upon me the sins of thee,
O man that was alive and is now white with
the stillness!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Neil Ross broke the bread and
ate of it, and took upon himself the sins of
Adam Blair that was dead. It was a bitter
swallowing, that. The remainder of the bread
he crumbled in his hand, and threw it on the
ground, and trod upon it. Andrew Blair gave
a sigh of relief. His cold eyes lightened with
malice.</p>

<p>“Be off with you, now, Macallum. We are
wanting no tramps at the farm here, and
perhaps you had better not be trying to get
work this side Iona; for it is known as
the Sin-Eater you will be, and that won’t be
for the helping, I am thinking! There: there
are the two half-crowns for you … and may
they bring you no harm, you that are <em>Scapegoat</em>
now!”</p>

<p>The Sin-Eater turned at that, and stared
like a hill-bull. <em>Scapegoat!</em> Ay, that’s what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he was. Sin-Eater, Scapegoat! Was he not,
too, another Judas, to have sold for silver
that which was not for the selling? No, no,
for sure Maisie Macdonald could tell him the
rune that would serve for the easing of this
burden. He would soon be quit of it.</p>

<p>Slowly he took the money, turned it over,
and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I am going, Andrew Blair,” he said quietly,
“I am going now. I will not say to him
that is there in the silence, <i lang="gd">A chuid do Pharas
da!</i>&mdash;nor will I say to you, <i lang="gd">Gu’n gleidheadh
Dia thu</i>,&mdash;nor will I say to this dwelling
that is the home of thee and thine, <i lang="gd">Gu’n
beannaicheadh Dia an tigh!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Here there was a pause. All listened.
Andrew Blair shifted uneasily, the furtive eyes
of him going this way and that, like a ferret
in the grass.</p>

<p>“But, Andrew Blair, I will say this: when
you fare abroad, <i lang="gd">Droch caoidh ort!</i> and when
you go upon the water, <i lang="gd">Gaoth gun direadh
ort!</i> Ay, ay, Anndra-mhic-Adam, <i>Dia ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

<p>The bitterness of these words was like snow
in June upon all there. They stood amazed.
None spoke. No one moved.</p>

<p>Neil Ross turned upon his heel, and, with
a bright light in his eyes, walked away from
the dead and the living. He went by the
byres, whence he had come. Andrew Blair
remained where he was, now glooming at the
corpse, now biting his nails and staring at the
damp sods at his feet.</p>

<p>When Neil reached the end of the milk-shed
he saw Maisie Macdonald there, waiting.</p>

<p>“These were ill sayings of yours, Neil Ross,”
she said in a low voice, so that she might not
be overheard from the house.</p>

<p>“So, it is knowing me you are.”</p>

<p>“Sheen Macarthur told me.”</p>

<p>“I have good cause.”</p>

<p>“That is a true word. I know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me this thing. What is the rune that
is said for the throwing into the sea of the
sins of the dead? See here, Maisie Macdonald.
There is no money of that man that
I would carry a mile with me. Here it is.
It is yours, if you will tell me that rune.”</p>

<p>Maisie took the money hesitatingly. Then,
stooping, she said slowly the few lines of the
old, old rune.</p>

<p>“Will you be remembering that?”</p>

<p>“It is not forgetting it I will be, Maisie.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. There is some warm
milk here.”</p>

<p>With that she went, and then, from within,
beckoned to him to enter.</p>

<p>“There is no one here, Neil Ross. Drink
the milk.”</p>

<p>He drank; and while he did so she drew a
leather pouch from some hidden place in her dress.</p>

<p>“And now I have this to give you.”</p>

<p>She counted out ten pennies and two
farthings.</p>

<p>“It is all the coppers I have. You are
welcome to them. Take them, friend of my
friend. They will give you the food you need,
and the ferry across the Sound.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will do that, Maisie Macdonald, and
thanks to you. It is not forgetting it I will
be, nor you, good woman. And now, tell me,
is it safe that I am? He called me a
‘scapegoat’; he, Andrew Blair! Can evil
touch me between this and the sea?”</p>

<p>“You must go to the place where the evil
was done to you and yours&mdash;and that, I
know, is on the west side of Iona. Go, and
God preserve you. But here, too, is a sian
that will be for the safety.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, with swift mutterings she said
this charm: an old, familiar Sian against
Sudden Harm:&mdash;</p>

<p>Scarcely had she finished before she heard
heavy steps approaching.</p>

<p>“Away with you,” she whispered, repeating
in a loud, angry tone, “Away with you!
<i lang="gd">Seachad!</i> <i lang="gd">Seachad!</i>”</p>

<p>And with that Neil Ross slipped from the
milk-shed and crossed the yard, and was behind
the byres before Andrew Blair, with sullen
mien and swift, wild eyes, strode from the house.</p>

<p>It was with a grim smile on his face that
Neil tramped down the wet heather till he
reached the high road, and fared thence as
through a marsh because of the rains there
had been.</p>

<p>For the first mile he thought of the angry
mind of the dead man, bitter at paying of
the silver. For the second mile he thought of
the evil that had been wrought for him and
his. For the third mile he pondered over all
that he had heard and done and taken upon
him that day.</p>

<p>Then he sat down upon a broken granite
heap by the way, and brooded deep till one
hour went, and then another, and the third
was upon him.</p>

<p>A man driving two calves came towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
him out of the west. He did not hear or
see. The man stopped: spoke again. Neil
gave no answer. The drover shrugged his
shoulders, hesitated, and walked slowly on,
often looking back.</p>

<p>An hour later a shepherd came by the way
he himself had tramped. He was a tall, gaunt
man with a squint. The small, pale-blue
eyes glittered out of a mass of red hair that
almost covered his face. He stood still,
opposite Neil, and leaned on his <i lang="gd">cromak</i>.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Latha math leat</i>,” he said at last: “I wish
you good day.”</p>

<p>Neil glanced at him, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“What is your name, for I seem to know
you?”</p>

<p>But Neil had already forgotten him. The
shepherd took out his snuff-mull, helped himself,
and handed the mull to the lonely wayfarer.
Neil mechanically helped himself.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Am bheil thu ’dol do Fhionphort?</i>” tried
the shepherd again: “Are you going to
Fionnaphort?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Tha mise ’dol a dh’ I-challum-chille</i>,”
Neil answered, in a low, weary voice, and as
a man adream: “I am on my way to Iona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am thinking I know now who you are.
You are the man Macallum.”</p>

<p>Neil looked, but did not speak. His eyes
dreamed against what the other could not
see or know. The shepherd called angrily
to his dogs to keep the sheep from straying;
then, with a resentful air, turned to his
victim.</p>

<p>“You are a silent man for sure, you are.
I’m hoping it is not the curse upon you
already.”</p>

<p>“What curse?”</p>

<p>“Ah, <em>that</em> has brought the wind against the
mist! I was thinking so!”</p>

<p>“What curse?”</p>

<p>“You are the man that was the Sin-Eater
over there?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“The man Macallum?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Strange it is, but three days ago I saw
you in Tobermory, and heard you give your
name as Neil Ross to an Iona man that was
there.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, it is nothing to me. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
say the Sin-Eater should not be a man with
a hidden lump in his pack.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“For the dead know, and are content.
There is no shaking off any sins, then&mdash;for
that man.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ay and maybe no.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you more to be saying to
me? I am obliged to you for your company,
but it is not needing it I am, though
no offence.”</p>

<p>“Och, man, there’s no offence between you
and me. Sure, there’s Iona in me, too; for
the father of my father married a woman that
was the granddaughter of Tomais Macdonald,
who was a fisherman there. No, no; it is
rather warning you I would be.”</p>

<p>“And for what?”</p>

<p>“Well, well, just because of that laugh I
heard about.”</p>

<p>“What laugh?”</p>

<p>“The laugh of Adam Blair that is dead.”</p>

<p>Neil Ross stared, his eyes large and wild.
He leaned a little forward. No word came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
from him. The look that was on his face
was the question.</p>

<p>“Yes: it was this way. Sure, the telling
of it is just as I heard it. After you ate the
sins of Adam Blair, the people there brought
out the coffin. When they were putting him
into it, he was as stiff as a sheep dead in
the snow&mdash;and just like that, too, with his
eyes wide open. Well, someone saw you
trampling the heather down the slope that
is in front of the house, and said, ‘It is the
Sin-Eater!’ With that, Andrew Blair sneered,
and said&mdash;‘Ay, ’tis the scapegoat he is!’ Then,
after a while, he went on: ‘The Sin-Eater
they call him: ay, just so: and a bitter good
bargain it is, too, if all’s true that’s thought
true!’ And with that he laughed, and then
his wife that was behind him laughed, and
then …”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis Himself that hears and knows
if it is true! But this is the thing I was
told:&mdash;After that laughing there was a stillness
and a dread. For all there saw that
the corpse had turned its head and was
looking after you as you went down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
heather. Then, Neil Ross, if that be your
true name, Adam Blair that was dead put
up his white face against the sky, and
laughed.”</p>

<p>At this, Ross sprang to his feet with a
gasping sob.</p>

<p>“It is a lie, that thing!” he cried, shaking
his fist at the shepherd. “It is a lie!”</p>

<p>“It is no lie. And by the same token,
Andrew Blair shrank back white and shaking,
and his woman had the swoon upon her, and
who knows but the corpse might have come
to life again had it not been for Maisie
Macdonald, the deid-watcher, who clapped a
handful of salt on his eyes, and tilted the
coffin so that the bottom of it slid forward,
and so let the whole fall flat on the ground,
with Adam Blair in it sideways, and as likely
as not cursing and groaning, as his wont was,
for the hurt both to his old bones and his old
ancient dignity.”</p>

<p>Ross glared at the man as though the madness
was upon him. Fear and horror and fierce
rage swung him now this way and now that.</p>

<p>“What will the name of you be, shepherd?”
he stuttered huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is Eachainn Gilleasbuig I am to ourselves;
and the English of that for those who
have no Gaelic is Hector Gillespie; and I am
Eachainn mac Ian mac Alasdair of Strathsheean
that is where Sutherland lies against
Ross.”</p>

<p>“Then take this thing&mdash;and that is, the
curse of the Sin-Eater! And a bitter bad
thing may it be upon you and yours.”</p>

<p>And with that Neil the Sin-Eater flung his
hand up into the air, and then leaped past the
shepherd, and a minute later was running
through the frightened sheep, with his head
low, and a white foam on his lips, and his
eyes red with blood as a seal’s that has the
death-wound on it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the third day of the seventh month
from that day, Aulay Macneill, coming into
Balliemore of Iona from the west side of the
island, said to old Ronald MacCormick, that
was the father of his wife, that he had seen
Neil Ross again, and that he was “absent”&mdash;for
though he had spoken to him, Neil would
not answer, but only gloomed at him from the
wet weedy rock where he sat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The going back of the man had loosed every
tongue that was in Iona. When, too, it was
known that he was wrought in some terrible
way, if not actually mad, the islanders whispered
that it was because of the sins of Adam
Blair. Seldom or never now did they speak
of him by his name, but simply as “The Sin-Eater.”
The thing was not so rare as to
cause this strangeness, nor did many (and
perhaps none did) think that the sins of the
dead ever might or could abide with the living
who had merely done a good Christian charitable
thing. But there was a reason.</p>

<p>Not long after Neil Ross had come again
to Iona, and had settled down in the ruined
roofless house on the croft of Ballyrona, just
like a fox or a wild-cat, as the saying was,
he was given fishing-work to do by Aulay
Macneill, who lived at Ard-an-teine, at the
rocky north end of the <i lang="gd">machar</i> or plain that
is on the west Atlantic coast of the island.</p>

<p>One moonlit night, either the seventh or
the ninth after the earthing of Adam Blair
at his own place in the Ross, Aulay Macneill
saw Neil Ross steal out of the shadow of
Ballyrona and make for the sea. Macneill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was there by the rocks, mending a lobster-creel.
He had gone there because of the
sadness. Well, when he saw the Sin-Eater,
he watched.</p>

<p>Neil crept from rock to rock till he reached
the last fang that churns the sea into yeast
when the tide sucks the land just opposite.</p>

<p>Then he called out something that Aulay
Macneill could not catch. With that he
springs up, and throws his arms above him.</p>

<p>“Then,” says Aulay when he tells the tale,
“it was like a ghost he was. The moonshine
was on his face like the curl o’ a wave.
White! there is no whiteness like that of the
human face. It was whiter than the foam
about the skerry it was; whiter than the moon
shining; whiter than … well, as white as
the painted letters on the black boards of
the fishing-cobles. There he stood, for all
that the sea was about him, the slip-slop
waves leapin’ wild, and the tide making, too,
at that. He was shaking like a sail two
points off the wind. It was then that, all of
a sudden, he called in a womany, screamin’
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘I am throwing the sins of Adam Blair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into the midst of ye, white dogs o’ the sea!
Drown them, tear them, drag them away out
into the black deeps! Ay, ay, ay, ye dancin’
wild waves, this is the third time I am doing
it, and now there is none left; no, not a sin,
not a sin!</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘O-hi, O-ri, dark tide o’ the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">I am giving the sins of a dead man to thee!</div>

<div class="verse">From the dead man’s sins set me free, set me free!</div>
<div class="verse">Adam mhic Anndra mhic Adam and me,</div>
<div class="verse">Set us free! Set us free!’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ay, sure, the Sin-Eater sang that over
and over; and after the third singing he
swung his arms and screamed&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘And listen to me, black waters an’ running tide,</div>
<div class="verse">That rune is the good rune told me by Maisie the wise,</div>
<div class="verse">And I am Neil the son of Silis Macallum</div>
<div class="verse">By the black-hearted evil man Murtagh Ross,</div>
<div class="verse">That was the friend of Adam mac Anndra, God against him!’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And with that he scrambled and fell into
the sea. But, as I am Aulay mac Luais
and no other, he was up in a moment, an’
swimmin’ like a seal, and then over the rocks
again, an’ away back to that lonely roofless
place once more, laughing wild at times, an’
muttering an’ whispering.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this tale of Aulay Macneill’s that
stood between Neil Ross and the isle-folk.
There was something behind all that, they
whispered one to another.</p>

<p>So it was always the Sin-Eater he was
called at last. None sought him. The few
children who came upon him now and again
fled at his approach, or at the very sight of
him. Only Aulay Macneill saw him at times,
and had word of him.</p>

<p>After a month had gone by, all knew that
the Sin-Eater was wrought to madness because
of this awful thing: the burden of Adam
Blair’s sins would not go from him! Night
and day he could hear them laughing low, it
was said.</p>

<p>But it was the quiet madness. He went to
and fro like a shadow in the grass, and almost
as soundless as that, and as voiceless. More
and more the name of him grew as a terror.
There were few folk on that wild west coast
of Iona, and these few avoided him when the
word ran that he had knowledge of strange
things, and converse, too, with the secrets of
the sea.</p>

<p>One day Aulay Macneill, in his boat, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
dumb with amaze and terror for him, saw him
at high tide swimming on a long rolling wave
right into the hollow of the Spouting Cave.
In the memory of man, no one had done this
and escaped one of three things: a snatching
away into oblivion, a strangled death, or madness.
The islanders know that there swims
into the cave, at full tide, a Mar-Tarbh, a
dreadful creature of the sea that some call a
kelpie; only it is not a kelpie, which is like
a woman, but rather is a sea-bull, offspring of
the cattle that are never seen. Ill indeed for
any sheep or goat, ay, or even dog or child,
if any happens to be leaning over the edge of
the Spouting Cave when the Mar-tarbh roars:
for, of a surety, it will fall in and straightway
be devoured.</p>

<p>With awe and trembling Aulay listened for
the screaming of the doomed man. It was
full tide, and the sea-beast would be there.</p>

<p>The minutes passed, and no sign. Only the
hollow booming of the sea, as it moved like a
baffled blind giant round the cavern-bases:
only the rush and spray of the water flung
up the narrow shaft high into the windy air
above the cliff it penetrates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he saw what looked like a mass of
sea-weed swirled out on the surge. It was the
Sin-Eater. With a leap, Aulay was at his
oars. The boat swung through the sea. Just
before Neil Ross was about to sink for the
second time, he caught him and dragged him
into the boat.</p>

<p>But then, as ever after, nothing was to be
got out of the Sin-Eater save a single saying:
<i lang="gd">Tha e lamhan fuar: Tha e lamhan fuar!</i>&mdash;“It
has a cold, cold hand!”</p>

<p>The telling of this and other tales left none
free upon the island to look upon the “scapegoat”
save as one accursed.</p>

<p>It was in the third month that a new phase
of his madness came upon Neil Ross.</p>

<p>The horror of the sea and the passion for
the sea came over him at the same happening.
Oftentimes he would race along the shore,
screaming wild names to it, now hot with hate
and loathing, now as the pleading of a man
with the woman of his love. And strange
chants to it, too, were upon his lips. Old,
old lines of forgotten runes were overheard by
Aulay Macneill, and not Aulay only: lines
wherein the ancient sea-name of the island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<i>Ioua</i>, that was given to it long before it was
called Iona, or any other of the nine names
that are said to belong to it, occurred again
and again.</p>

<p>The flowing tide it was that wrought him
thus. At the ebb he would wander across
the weedy slabs or among the rocks: silent,
and more like a lost duinshee than a man.</p>

<p>Then again after three months a change in
his madness came. None knew what it was,
though Aulay said that the man moaned and
moaned because of the awful burden he bore.
No drowning seas for the sins that could not
be washed away, no grave for the live sins
that would be quick till the day of the Judgment!</p>

<p>For weeks thereafter he disappeared. As
to where he was, it is not for the knowing.</p>

<p>Then at last came that third day of the
seventh month when, as I have said, Aulay
Macneill told old Ronald MacCormick that he
had seen the Sin-Eater again.</p>

<p>It was only a half-truth that he told, though.
For, after he had seen Neil Ross upon the
rock, he had followed him when he rose, and
wandered back to the roofless place which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
haunted now as of yore. Less wretched a
shelter now it was, because of the summer
that was come, though a cold, wet summer at
that.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Neil Ross?” he had asked, as
he peered into the shadows among the ruins
of the house.</p>

<p>“That’s not my name,” said the Sin-Eater;
and he seemed as strange then and there, as
though he were a castaway from a foreign
ship.</p>

<p>“And what will it be, then, you that are
my friend, and sure knowing me as Aulay
mac Luais&mdash;Aulay Macneill that never grudges
you bit or sup?”</p>

<p>“<em>I am Judas.</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And at that word,” says Aulay Macneill,
when he tells the tale, “at that word the
pulse in my heart was like a bat in a shut
room. But after a bit I took up the talk.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed,’ I said; ‘and I was not for knowing
that. May I be so bold as to ask whose
son, and of what place?’</p>

<p>“But all he said to me was, ‘<cite>I am Judas.</cite>’</p>

<p>“Well, I said, to comfort him, ‘Sure, it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
not such a bad name in itself, though I am
knowing some which have a more home-like
sound.’ But no, it was no good.</p>

<p>“‘I am Judas. And because I sold the Son
of God for five pieces of silver …’</p>

<p>“But here I interrupted him and said,&mdash;‘Sure,
now, Neil&mdash;I mean, Judas&mdash;it was eight
times five.’ Yet the simpleness of his sorrow
prevailed, and I listened with the wet in my
eyes.</p>

<p>“‘I am Judas. And because I sold the
Son of God for five silver shillings, He laid
upon me all the nameless black sins of the
world. And that is why I am bearing them
till the Day of Days.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this was the end of the Sin-Eater;
for I will not tell the long story of Aulay
Macneill, that gets longer and longer every
winter: but only the unchanging close of it.</p>

<p>I will tell it in the words of Aulay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“A bitter, wild day it was, that day I saw
him to see him no more. It was late. The
sea was red with the flamin’ light that burned
up the air betwixt Iona and all that is west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of West. I was on the shore, looking at the
sea. The big green waves came in like the
chariots in the Holy Book. Well, it was on
the black shoulder of one of them, just short
of the ton o’ foam that swept above it, that
I saw a spar surgin’ by.</p>

<p>“‘What is that?’ I said to myself. And
the reason of my wondering was this: I saw
that a smaller spar was swung across it. And
while I was watching that thing another great
billow came in with a roar, and hurled the
double spar back, and not so far from me
but I might have gripped it. But who would
have gripped that thing if he were for seeing
what I saw?</p>

<p>“It is Himself knows that what I say is a
true thing.</p>

<p>“On that spar was Neil Ross, the Sin-Eater.
Naked he was as the day he was born. And
he was lashed, too&mdash;ay, sure, he was lashed
to it by ropes round and round his legs and
his waist and his left arm. It was the Cross
he was on. I saw that thing with the fear
upon me. Ah, poor drifting wreck that he
was! <i>Judas on the Cross</i>: It was his <i lang="gd">eric</i>!</p>

<p>“But even as I watched, shaking in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
limbs, I saw that there was life in him still.
The lips were moving, and his right arm was
ever for swinging this way and that. ’Twas
like an oar, working him off a lee shore: ay,
that was what I thought.</p>

<p>“Then, all at once, he caught sight of me.
Well he knew me, poor man, that has his
share of heaven now, I am thinking!</p>

<p>“He waved, and called, but the hearing
could not be, because of a big surge o’ water
that came tumbling down upon him. In the
stroke of an oar he was swept close by the
rocks where I was standing. In that flounderin’,
seethin’ whirlpool I saw the white face
of him for a moment, an’ as he went out on
the re-surge like a hauled net, I heard these
words fallin’ against my ears,&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘<i lang="gd">An eirig m’anama</i> … In ransom for
my soul!’</p>

<p>“And with that I saw the double-spar turn
over and slide down the back-sweep of a
drowning big wave. Ay, sure, it went out
to the deep sea swift enough then. It was
in the big eddy that rushes between Skerry-Mòr
and Skerry-Beag. I did not see it
again&mdash;no, not for the quarter of an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I am thinking. Then I saw just the whirling
top of it rising out of the flying yeast of a
great, black-blustering wave, that was rushing
northward before the current that is called the
Black-Eddy.</p>

<p>“With that you have the end of Neil Ross:
ay, sure, him that was called the Sin-Eater.
And that is a true thing; and may God save
us the sorrow of sorrows.</p>

<p>“And that is all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE NINTH WAVE</h3>

<p>The wind fell as we crossed the Sound.
There was only one oar in the boat, and we
lay idly adrift. The tide was still on the ebb,
and so we made way for Soa; though, well
before the island could be reached, the tide
would turn, and the sea-wind would stir, and
we be up the Sound and at Balliemore again
almost as quick as the laying of a net.</p>

<p>As we&mdash;and by “us” I am meaning Phadric
Macrae and Ivor McLean, fishermen of Iona,
and myself beside Ivor at the helm&mdash;as we
slid slowly past the ragged islet known as
Eilean-na-h’ Aon-Chaorach, torn and rent by
the tides and surges of a thousand years, I
saw a school of seals basking in the sun.
One by one slithered into the water, and
I could note the dark forms, like moving
patches of sea-weed, drifting in the green
underglooms.</p>

<p>Then, after a time, we bore down upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Sgeir-na-Oir, a barren rock. Three great cormorants
stood watching us. Their necks shone
in the sunlight like snakes mailed in blue
and green. On the upper ledges were eight
or ten northern-divers. They did not seem
to see us, though I knew that their fierce
light-blue eyes noted every motion we made.
The small sea-ducks bobbed up and down,
first one flirt of a little black-feathered rump,
then another, then a third, till a score or so
were under water, and half-a-hundred more
were ready at a moment’s notice to follow
suit. A skua hopped among the sputtering
weed, and screamed disconsolately at intervals.
Among the myriad colonies of close-set
mussels, which gave a blue bloom like that
of the sloe to the weed-covered boulders, a
few kittiwakes and dotterels flitted to and fro.
High overhead, white against the blue as a
cloudlet, a gannet hung motionless, seemingly
frozen to the sky.</p>

<p>Below the lapse of the boat the water was
pale green. I could see the liath and
saith fanning their fins in slow flight, and
sometimes a little scurrying cloud of tiny
flukies and inch-long codling. For two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
three fathoms beyond the boat the waters
were blue. If blueness can be alive and have
its own life and movement, it must be happy
on these western seas, where it dreams into
shadowy Lethes of amethyst and deep, dark
oblivions of violet.</p>

<p>Suddenly a streak of silver ran for a
moment along the sea to starboard. It was
like an arrow of moonlight shot along the
surface of the blue and gold. Almost immediately
afterward, a stertorous sigh was audible.
A black knife cut the flow of the water: the
shoulder of a pollack.</p>

<p>“The mackerel are coming in from the sea,”
said Macrae. He leaned forward, wet the palm
of his hand, and held it seaward. “Ay, the
tide has turned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div class="verse"><i lang="gd">Ohrone&mdash;achree&mdash;an&mdash;Lionadh!”</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he droned monotonously, over and over, with
few variations.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“An’ it’s Oh an’ Oh for the tides o’ the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">An’ it’s Oh for the flowing tide,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I sang at last in mockery.</p>

<p>“Come, Phadric,” I cried, “you are as bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as Peter McAlpin’s lassie, Fiona, with the
pipes!”</p>

<p>Both men laughed lightly. On the last
Sabbath, old McAlpin had held a prayer-meeting
in his little house in the “street,” in
Balliemore of Iona. At the end of his discourse
he told his hearers that the voice of
God was terrible only to the evil-doer, but
beautiful to the righteous man, and that this
voice was even now among them, speaking
in a thousand ways, and yet in one way.
And at this moment, that elfin granddaughter
of his, who was in the byre close by, let go
upon the pipes with so long and weary a
whine that the collies by the fire whimpered,
and would have howled outright but for the
Word of God that still lay open on the big
stool in front of old Peter. For it was in this
way that the dogs knew when the Sabbath
readings were over, and there was not one
that would dare to bark or howl, much less
rise and go out, till the Book was closed with
a loud, solemn bang. Well, again and again
that weary quavering moan went up and
down the room, till even old McAlpin smiled,
though he was fair angry with Fiona. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he made the sign of silence, and began: “My
brethren, even in this trial it may be the
Almighty has a message for us&mdash;&mdash;,” when
at that moment Fiona was kicked by a cow,
and fell against the board with the pipes, and
squeezed out so wild a wail that McAlpin
started up and cried, in the Lowland way
that he had won out of his wife, “<i>Hoots,
havers, an’ a’! come oot o’ that, ye deil’s
spunkie!</i>”</p>

<p>So it was this memory that made Phadric
and Ivor smile. Suddenly Ivor began, with
a long rising and falling cadence, an old
Gaelic rune of the Faring of the Tide:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both men sang the closing lines, with loudly
swelling voices, and with a wailing fervour
which no words of mine could convey.</p>

<p>Runes of this kind prevail all over the isles,
from the Butt of Lewis to the Rhinns of
Islay: identical in spirit, though varying in
lines and phrases, according to the mood and
temperament of the <i lang="gd">rannaiche</i> or singer, the
local or peculiar physiognomy of nature, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
instinctive yielding to hereditary wonder-words,
and other compelling circumstances of the
outer and inner life. Almost needless to say,
the sea-maid or sea-witch and the Wave-Haunter
occur in many of those wild runes,
particularly in those that are impromptu. In
the Outer Hebrides, the runes are wild natural
hymns rather than Pagan chants: though
marked distinctions prevail there also,&mdash;for in
Harris and the Lews the folk are Protestant
almost to a man, while in Benbecula and
the Southern Hebrides the Catholics are in
a like ascendancy. But all are at one in the
common Brotherhood of Sorrow.</p>

<p>The only lines in Ivor McLean’s wailing
song which puzzled me were the two last
which came before “the good words,” “in
the name of the Father, the Son, and the
Spirit,” etc.</p>

<p>“Tell me, in English, Ivor,” I said, after a
silence, wherein I pondered the Gaelic words,
“what is the meaning of</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘And may there be no calling in the Flow, this Srùth-màra,</div>
<div class="verse">And may there be no burden in the Ebb’?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Yes, I will be telling you what is the meaning
of that. When the great tide that wells out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the hollow of the sea, and sweeps towards
all the coasts of the world, first stirs, when
she will be knowing that the Ebb is not any
more moving at all, she sends out nine long
waves. And I will be forgetting what these
waves are: but one will be to shepherd the
sea-weed that is for the blessing of man; and
another is for to wake the fish that sleep in
the deeps; and another is for this, and another
will be for that; and the seventh is to rouse
the Wave-Haunter and all the creatures of
the water that fear and hate man; and the
eighth no man knows, though the priests say
it is to carry the Whisper of Mary; and the
ninth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the ninth, Ivor?”</p>

<p>“May it be far from us, from you and from
me, and from those of us. An’ I will be
sayin’ nothing against it, not I; nor against
anything that is in the sea. An’ you will be
noting that!</p>

<p>“Well, this ninth wave goes through the
water on the forehead of the tide. An’ wherever
it will be going it <em>calls</em>. An’ the call of it is&mdash;‘<i>Come
away, come away, the sea waits!
Follow!… Come away, come away, the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
waits! Follow!</i>’<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> An’ whoever hears that
must arise and go, whether he be fish or
pollack, or seal or otter, or great skua or
small tern, or bird or beast of the shore, or
bird or beast of the sea, or whether it be
man or woman or child, or any of the others.”</p>

<p>“<em>Any of the others</em>, Ivor?”</p>

<p>“I will not be saying anything about that,”
replied McLean gravely; “you will be knowing
well what I mean, and if you do not it
is not for me to talk of that which is not to
be talked about.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was for saying, that calling of
the ninth wave of the Tide is what Ian Mòr
of the hills speaks of as ‘the whisper of the
snow that falls on the hair, the whisper of
the frost that lies on the cold face of him
that will never be waking again.’”</p>

<p>“<em>Death?</em>”</p>

<p>“It is <em>you</em> that will be saying it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he resumed, after a moment’s hush,
“a man may live by the sea for five-score
years and never hear that ninth wave call in
any <i lang="gd">Srùth-màra</i>; but soon or late he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hear it. An’ many is the Flood that will be
silent for all of us; but there will be one
Flood for each of us that will be a dreadful
Voice, a voice of terror and of dreadfulness.
And whoever hears that voice, he for sure
will be the burden in the Ebb.”</p>

<p>“Has any heard that Voice, and lived?”</p>

<p>McLean looked at me, but said nothing.
Phadric Macrae rose, tautened a rope, and
made a sign to me to put the helm a-lee.
Then, looking into the green water slipping
by&mdash;for the tide was feeling our keel, and a
stronger breath from the sea lay against the
hollow that was growing in the sail&mdash;he said
to Ivor:</p>

<p>“You should be telling her of Ivor MacIvor
Mhic Niall.”</p>

<p>“Who was Ivor MacNeill?” I said.</p>

<p>“He was the father of my mother,” answered
McLean, “and was known throughout the
north isles as Ivor Carminish: for he had a
farm on the eastern lands of Carminish which
lie between the hills called Strondeval and
Rondeval, that are in the far south of the
Northern Hebrides, and near what will be
known to you as the Obb of Harris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I will now be telling you about him
in the Gaelic, for it is more easy to me, and
more pleasant for us all.</p>

<p>“When Ivor MacEachainn Carminish, that
was Ivor’s father, died, he left the farm to
his elder son, and to his second son Sheumais.
By this time Ivor was married, and had the
daughter who is my mother. But he was a
lonely man, and an islesman to the heart’s
core. So … but you will be knowing the
isles that lie off the Obb of Harris: the
Saghay, and Ensay, and Killegray, and, farther
west, Berneray; and north-west, Pabaidh; and,
beyond that again, Shillaidh?”</p>

<p>For the moment I was confused, for these
names are so common: and I was thinking
of the big isle of Berneray that lies in huge
Loch Roag that has swallowed so great a
mouthful of Western Lewis, to the seaward
of which also are the two Pabbays, Pabaidh
Mòr and Pabaidh Beag. But when McLean
added, “and other isles of the Caolas Harrish
(the Sound of Harris),” I remembered aright;
and indeed I knew both, though the nor’ isles
better, for I had lived near Callernish on the
inner waters of Roag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Carminish had sheep-runs upon some
of these. One summer the gloom came upon
him, and he left Sheumais to take care of
the farm, and of Morag his wife, and of Sheen
their daughter; and he went to live upon
Pabbay, near the old castle that is by the
Rua Dune on the south-east of the isle.
There he stayed for three months. But on
the last night of each month he heard the
sea calling in his sleep; and what he heard
was like ‘<cite>Come away, come away, the sea
waits! Follow!</cite>… <cite>Come away, come
away, the sea waits! Follow!</cite>’ And he knew
the voice of the ninth wave; and that it would
not be there in the darkness of sleep if it
were not already moving towards him through
the dark ways of <i lang="gd">An Dàn</i> (Destiny). So,
thinking to pass away from a place doomed
for him, and that he might be safe elsewhere,
he sailed north to a kinsman’s croft on Aird-Vanish
in the island of Taransay. But at the
end of that month he heard in his sleep the
noise of tidal waters, and at the gathering of
the ebb he heard ‘<cite>Come away, come away,
the sea waits! Follow!</cite>’ Then once more,
when the November heat-spell had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he sailed farther northward still. He stopped
awhile at Eilean Mhealastaidh, which is under
the morning shadow of high Griomabhal on
the mainland, and at other places; till he
settled, in the third week, at his cousin
Eachainn MacEachainn’s bothy, near Callernish,
where the Great Stones of old stand
by the sea, and hear nothing for ever but
the noise of the waves of the North Sea
and the cry of the sea-wind.</p>

<p>“And when the last night of November had
come and gone, and he had heard in his sleep
no calling of the ninth wave of the Flowing
Tide, he took heart of grace. All through
that next day he went in peace. Eachainn
wondered often with slant eyes when he saw the
morose man smile, and heard his silence give
way now and again to a short, mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>“The two were at the porridge, and
Eachainn was muttering his <i lang="gd">Bui’cheas dha’n
Ti</i>, the Thanks to the Being, when Carminish
suddenly leaped to his feet, and, with white
face, stood shaking like a rope in the wind.</p>

<p>“‘In the name of the Son, what is it, Ivor
Mhic Ivor? What is it, Carminish?’ cried
Eachainn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the stricken man could scarce speak.
At last, with a long sigh, he turned and
looked at his kinsman, and that look went
down into the shivering heart like the polar
wind into a crofter’s hut.</p>

<p>“‘<em>What will be that?</em>’ said Carminish, in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Eachainn listened, but he could hear no
wailing <i lang="gd">beann-sith</i>, no unwonted sound.</p>

<p>“‘Sure, I hear nothing but the wind moaning
through the Great Stones, an’ beyond them the
noise of the Flowin’ Tide.’</p>

<p>“‘The Flowing Tide! the Flowing Tide!’
cried Carminish, and no longer with the hush
in the voice. ‘An’ what is it you hear in the
Flowing Tide?’</p>

<p>“Eachainn looked in silence. What was the
thing he could say? For now he knew.</p>

<p>“‘Ah, och, och, ochone, you may well sigh,
Eachainn Mhic Eachainn! For the ninth
wave o’ the Flowing Tide is coming out o’ the
North Sea upon this shore, an’ already I can
hear it calling ‘<cite>Come away, come away, the
sea waits! Follow!</cite>… <cite>Come away, come
away, the sea waits! Follow!</cite>’</p>

<p>“And with that Carminish dashed out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
light that was upon the table, and leaped
upon Eachainn, and dinged him to the floor,
and would have killed him, but for the growing
noise of the sea beyond the Stannin’
Stones o’ Callernish, and the woe-weary sough
o’ the wind, an’ the calling, calling, ‘<cite>Come, come
away!</cite> <cite>Come, come away!</cite>’</p>

<p>“And so he rose and staggered to the door,
and flung himself out into the night: while
Eachainn lay upon the floor and gasped for
breath, and then crawled to his knees, an’
took the Book from the shelf by his fern-straw
mattress, an’ put his cheek against it,
an’ moaned to God, an’ cried like a child for
the doom that was upon Ivor McIvor Mhic
Niall, who was of his own blood, and his own
<i lang="gd">dall</i> at that.</p>

<p>“And while he moaned, Carminish was stalking
through the great, gaunt, looming Stones
of the Druids that were here before St
Colum and his <i lang="gd">Shona</i> came, and laughing wild.
And all the time the tide was coming in,
and the tide and the deep sea and the waves
of the shore, and the wind in the salt grass
and the weary reeds and the black-pool gale,
made a noise of a dreadful hymn, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the death-hymn, the going-rune of Ivor the
son of Ivor of the kindred of Niall.</p>

<p>“And it was there that they found his body
in the grey dawn, wet and stiff with the salt
ooze. For the soul that was in him had
heard the call of the ninth wave that was for
him. So, and may the Being keep back that
hour for us, there was a burden upon that
ebb on the morning of that day.</p>

<p>“Also, there is this thing for the hearing.
In the dim dark before the curlew cried at
dawn, Eachainn heard a voice about the house,
a voice going like a thing blind and baffled,</p>

<h3>THE JUDGMENT O’ GOD</h3>

<p>The wind that blows on the feet of the dead
came calling loud across the Ross as we put
about the boat off the Rudhe Callachain. The
ebb sucked at the keel, while, like a cork,
we were swung lightly by the swell. For
we were in the strait between Eilean Dubh
and the Isle of the Swine; and that is where
the current has a bad pull&mdash;the current that
is made of the inflow and the outflow. I
have heard that a weary woman of the olden
days broods down there in a cave, and that
day and night she weaves a web of water,
which a fierce spirit in the sea tears this way
and that as soon as woven.</p>

<p>So we put about, and went before the east
wind: and below the dip of the sail a-lee I
watched Soa grow bigger and gaunter and
blacker against the white wave. As we came
so near that it was as though the wash of the
sea among the hollows bubbled in our ears, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
saw a large bull-seal lying half-in half-out of
the water, and staring at us with an angry,
fearless look.</p>

<p>Phadric and Ivor caught sight of it almost
at the same moment.</p>

<p>To my surprise Macrae suddenly rose and
put a rosad upon it. I could hear the wind
through his clothes as he stood by the mast.</p>

<p>The rosad or spell was, of course, in the
Gaelic; but its meaning was something like
this&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>With a slow swinging motion of his head
Phadric broke out again into the first words
of the incantation, and now Ivor joined him;
and with the call of the wind and the leaping
and the splashing of the waves was blent the
chant of the two fishermen&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the men sat back, with that dazed
look in the eyes I have so often seen in those
of men or women of the Isles who are wrought.
No word was spoken till we came almost
straight upon Eilean-na-h’ Aon-Chaorach. Then
at the rocks we tacked, and went splashing up
the Sound like a pollack on a Sabbath noon.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was wrong with the old man of the
sea?” I asked Macrae.</p>

<p>At first he would say nothing. He looked
vaguely at a coiled rope; then, with hand-shaded
gaze, across to the red rocks at Fionnaphort.
I repeated my question. He took
refuge in English.</p>

<p>“It wass ferry likely the <i>Clansman</i> would
be pringing ta new minister-body. Did you pe
knowing him, or his people, or where he came
from?”</p>

<p>But I was not to be put off thus; and at
last, while Ivor stared down the green-shelving
lawns of the sea below us, Phadric told me
this thing. His reluctance was partly due to
the shyness which, with the Gael, almost
invariably follows strong emotion, and partly
to that strange, obscure, secretive instinct
which is also so characteristically Celtic, and
often prevents Gaels of far apart isles, or of
different clans, from communicating to each
other stories or legends of a peculiarly intimate
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will tell you what my father told me,
and what, if you like, you may hear again
from the sister of my father, who is the wife
of Ian Finlay, who has the farm on the
north side of Dûn-I.</p>

<p>“You will have heard of old James Achanna
of Eilanmore, off the Ord o’ Sutherland? To
be sure, for have you not stayed there. Well,
I need not tell you how he came there out
of the south, but it will be news to you to
learn that my elder brother Murdoch was
had by him as a shepherd, and to help on
the farm. And the way of that thing was
this. Murdoch had gone to the fishing north
of Skye, with Angus and William Macdonald,
and in the great gale that broke up their
boat, among so many others, he found himself
stranded on Eilanmore. Achanna told him
that, as he was ruined, and so far from home,
he would give him employment; and though
Murdoch had never thought to serve under a
Galloway man, he agreed.</p>

<p>“For a year he worked on the upper farm,
Ardoch-beag as it was called. There the
gloom came upon him. Turn which way he
would, the beauty that is in the day was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
more. In vain, when he came out into the air
in the morning did he cry <i lang="gd">Deasiul</i>! and keep
by the sun-way. At night he heard the sea
calling in his sleep. So, when the lambing
was over, he told Achanna that he must go,
for he hungered for the sea. True, the wave
ran all around Eilanmore, but the farm was
between bare hills and among high moors,
and the house was in a hollow place. But it
was needful for him to go. Even then, though
he did not know it, the madness of the sea
was upon him.</p>

<p>“But the Galloway man did not wish to lose
my brother, who was a quiet man, and worked
for a small wage. Murdoch was a silent lad,
but he had often the light in his eyes, and
none knew of what he was thinking: maybe
it was of a lass, or a friend, or of the
ingle-neuk where his old mother sang o’
nights, or of the sight and sound of Iona that
was his own land; but I’m considerin’ it was
the sea he was dreamin’ of, how the waves
ran laughin’ an’ dancin’ against the tide, like
lambkins comin’ to meet the shepherd, or how
the big green billows went sweepin’ white
an’ ghostly through the moonless nights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“So the troth that was come to between
them was this: that Murdoch should abide
for a year longer, that is till Lammastide; then
that he should no longer live at Ardoch-beag,
but, instead, should go and keep the sheep on
Bac-Mòr.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“On Bac-Mòr, Phadric,” I interrupted,
“for sure, you do not mean <em>our</em> Bac-Mòr?”</p>

<p>“For sure, I mean no other: Bac-Mòr, of
the Treshnish Isles, that is eleven miles north
of Iona, and a long four north-west of Staffa:
an’ just Bac-Mòr, an’ no other.”</p>

<p>“Murdoch would be near home, there.”</p>

<p>“Ay, near, an’ farther away: for ’tis to be
farther off to be near that which your heart
loves but ye can’t get.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Well, Murdoch agreed to this, but he did
not know there was no boat on the island.
It was all very well in the summer. The
herrin’ smacks lay off Bac-Mòr or Bac-beag
many a time; and he could see them mornin’,
noon, an’ night; an’ nigh every day he could
watch the big steamer comin’ southward down
the Mornish and Treshnish coasts of Mull, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
stand by for an hour off Staffa, or else come
northward out of the Sound of Iona round
the Eilean Rabach; and once or twice a
week he saw the <i>Clansman</i> coming or going
from Bunessan in the Ross to Scarnish in the
Isle of Tiree. Maybe, too, now and again,
a foreign sloop or a coasting schooner would
sail by; and twice, at least, a yacht lay off
the wild shore, and put a boat in at the
landing-place, and let some laughing folk
loose upon that quiet place. The first time
it was a steam yacht, owned by a rich
foreigner, either an Englishman or an American,&mdash;I
misremember now,&mdash;an’ he spoke to
Murdoch as though he were a savage, and he
and his gay folk laughed when my brother
spoke in the only English he had (an’ sober,
good English it was), an’ then he shoves some
money into his hand, as though both were
evil-doers and were ashamed to be seen doing
what they did.</p>

<p>“‘An’ what is this for?’ said my brother.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it’s for yourself, my man, to drink
our health with,’ answered the English lord,
or whatever he was, rudely. Then Murdoch
looked at him and his quietly, an’ he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
‘God has your health an’ my health in the
hollow of His hands. But I wish you well.
Only, I am not being your man, any more
than I am for calling <em>you</em>, <em>my</em> man; an’ I
will ask you to take back this money to
drink with; nor have I any need for money,
but only for that which is free to all, but
that only God can give,’ And with that the
foreign people went away, and laughed less.
But when the second yacht came, though it
was a yawl and owned by a Glasgow man
who had folk in the west, Murdoch would
not come down to the shore, but lay under
the shadow of a rock amid his sheep, and
kept his eyes upon the sun that was moving
west out of the south.</p>

<p>“Well, all through the fine months Murdoch
stayed on Bac-Mòr, and thereafter through
the early winter. The last time I saw him
was at the New Year. On Hogmanay night
my father was drinking hard, and nothing
would serve him but he must borrow Alec
Macarthur’s boat, and that he and our mother
and myself, and Ian Finlay and his wife, my
sister, should go out before the quiet south
wind that was blowing, and see Murdoch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
where he lay sleeping or sat dreaming in his
lonely bothy. And, truth, we went. It was
a white sailing that I remember. The moon-shinings
ran in and out of the wavelets like
herrings through salmon nets. The fire-flauchts,
too, went speeding about. I was but a laddie
then, an’ I noted it all; an’ the sheet-lightning
that played behind the cloudy lift in the
nor’-west.</p>

<p>“But when we got to Bac-Mòr there was
no sign of Murdoch at the bothy: no, not
though we called high and low. Then my
father and Ian Finlay went to look, and
we stayed by the peats. When they came
back, an hour later, I saw that my father
was no more in drink. He had the same
look in his eyes as Ronald McLean had that
day last winter when they told him his bit
girlie had been caught by the small-pox in
Glasgow.</p>

<p>“I could not hear, or I could not make
out, what was said; but I know that we all
got into the boat again, all except my father.
And he stayed. And next day Ian Finlay
and Alec Macarthur went out to Bac-Mòr,
and brought him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“And from him and from Ian I knew all
there was to be known. It was a hard New
Year for all, and since that day, till a night
of which I will tell you, my father brooded
and drank, drank and brooded, and my
mother wept through the winter gloamings
and spent the nights starin’ into the peats, wi’
her knittin’ lyin’ on her lap.</p>

<p>“For when they had gone to seek Murdoch
that Hogmanay night, they came upon
him away from his sheep. But this was
what they saw. There was a black rock
that stood out in the moonshine, with the
water all about it; and on this rock Murdoch
lay naked, and laughing wild. An’ every
now and then he would lean forward and
stretch his arms out, an’ call to his dearie.
An’ at last, just as the watchers, shiverin’ wi’
fear an’ awe, were going to close in upon
him, they saw a&mdash;a&mdash;thing&mdash;come out o’ the
water. It was long an’ dark, an’ Ian said
its eyes were like clots o’ blood; but as to
that no man can say yea or nay, for Ian
himself admits it was a seal.</p>

<p>“An’ this thing is true, <i lang="gd">an ainm an Athar</i>!
they saw the dark beast o’ the sea creep on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to the rock beside Murdoch, an’ lie down
beside him, and let him clasp an’ kiss it.
An’ then he stood up, and laughed till the
skin crept on those who heard, and cried
out on his dearie and on a’ the dumb things
o’ the sea, an’ the Wave-Haunter an’ the
Grey Shadow; an’ he raised his hands, an’
cursed the world o’ men, and cried out to
God, ‘<i>Turn your face to your own airidh,
O God, an’ may rain an’ storm an’ snow be
between us!</i>’</p>

<p>“An’ wi’ that, Deirg, his collie, could bide
no more, but loupit across the water, and
was on the rock beside him, wi’ his fell
bristling like a hedge-rat. For both the naked
man an’ the wet, gleamin’ beast, a great she-seal
out o’ the north, turned upon Deirg, an’
he fought for his life. But what could the
puir thing do? The seal buried her fangs
in his shoulder at last, an’ pinned him to the
ground. Then Murdoch stooped, an’ dragged
her off, an’ bent down an’ tore at the throat
o’ Deirg wi’ his own teeth. Ay, God’s truth
it is! An’ when the collie was stark, he
took him up by the hind legs an’ the tail,
an’ swung him round an’ round his head, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
whirled him into the sea, where he fell black
in a white splatch o’ the moon.</p>

<p>“An’ wi’ that, Murdoch slipped, and reeled
backward into the sea, his hands gripping at
the whirling stars. An’ the thing beside him
louped after him, an’ my father an’ Ian heard
a cry an’ a cryin’ that made their hearts sob.
But when they got down to the rock they saw
nothing, except the floating body o’ Deirg.</p>

<p>“Sure it was a weary night for the old
man, there on Bac-Mòr by himself, with
that awful thing that had happened. He
stayed there to see and hear what might be
seen and heard. But nothing he heard&mdash;nothing
saw. It was afterwards that he heard
how Donncha MacDonald was on Bac-Mòr
three days before this, and how Murdoch had
told him he was in love wi’ a <i lang="gd">maighdeann-mhara</i>,
a sea-maid.</p>

<p>“But this thing has to be known. It was
a month later, on the night o’ the full moon,
that Ian Finlay and Ian Macarthur and
Sheumais Macallum were upset in the calm
water inside the Sound, just off Port-na-Frang,
and were nigh drowned, but that they
called upon God and the Son, and so escaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and heard no more the laughter of Murdoch
from the sea.</p>

<p>“And at midnight my father heard the
voice of his eldest son at the door; but he
would not let him in. And in the morning
he found his boat broken and shred in
splinters, and his one net all torn. An’ that
day was the Sabbath; so, being a holy day,
he took the Scripture with him, an’ he and
Neil Morrison the minister, having had the
Bread an’ Wine, went along the Sound in
a boat, following a shadow in the water, till
they came to Soa. An’ there Neil Morrison
read the Word o’ God to the seals that lay
baskin’ in the sun; and one, a female, snarled
and showed her fangs; and another, a black
one, lifted its head and made a noise that
was not like the barking of any seal, but was
as the laughter of Murdoch when he swung
the dead body of Deirg.</p>

<p>“And that is all that is to be said. And
silence is best now between you and any
other. And no man knows the judgments
o’ God.</p>

<p>“And that is all.”</p>

<h3><i>NOTE</i></h3>

<p>This story is one of the Achanna
series, of which “The Anointed
Man” is in <cite>Spiritual Tales</cite>, and
“The Dàn-nan-Ròn” is in the
present volume&mdash;to which, indeed,
“Green Branches” is properly a
sequel. (See the note to “The
Dàn-nan-Ròn” about the name
‘Gloom.’ I may add here that the
surname Achanna is that familiar
in the South as Hannay.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h3>GREEN BRANCHES</h3>

<p>In the year that followed the death of Mànus
MacCodrum, James Achanna saw nothing of
his brother Gloom. He might have thought
himself alone in the world, of all his people,
but for a letter that came to him out of the
west. True, he had never accepted the common
opinion that his brothers had both been
drowned on that night when Anne Gillespie
left Eilanmore with Mànus. In the first place,
he had nothing of that inner conviction concerning
the fate of Gloom which he had concerning
that of Marcus; in the next, had he
not heard the sound of the <i lang="gd">feadan</i>, which no
one that he knew played, except Gloom; and,
for further token, was not the tune that which
he hated above all others&mdash;the Dance of the
Dead&mdash;for who but Gloom would be playing
that, he hating it so, and the hour being late,
and no one else on Eilanmore? It was no
sure thing that the dead had not come back;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but the more he thought of it the more
Achanna believed that his sixth brother was
still alive. Of this, however, he said nothing
to anyone.</p>

<p>It was as a man set free that, at last, after
long waiting and patient trouble with the disposal
of all that was left of the Achanna
heritage, he left the island. It was a grey
memory for him. The bleak moorland of it,
the blight that had lain so long and so often
upon the crops, the rains that had swept the
isle for grey days and grey weeks and grey
months, the sobbing of the sea by day and
its dark moan by night, its dim relinquishing
sigh in the calm of dreary ebbs, its hollow
baffling roar when the storm-shadow swept up
out of the sea, one and all oppressed him,
even in memory. He had never loved the
island, even when it lay green and fragrant
in the green and white seas under white and
blue skies, fresh and sweet as an Eden of the
sea. He had ever been lonely and weary,
tired of the mysterious shadow that lay upon
his folk, caring little for any of his brothers
except the eldest&mdash;long since mysteriously gone
out of the ken of man&mdash;and almost hating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Gloom, who had ever borne him a grudge
because of his beauty, and because of his likeness
to and reverent heed for Alison. Moreover,
ever since he had come to love Katreen
Macarthur, the daughter of Donald Macarthur
who lived in Sleat of Skye, he had been eager
to live near her; the more eager as he knew
that Gloom loved the girl also, and wished for
success not only for his own sake, but so as
to put a slight upon his younger brother.</p>

<p>So, when at last he left the island, he sailed
southward gladly. He was leaving Eilanmore;
he was bound to a new home in Skye, and
perhaps he was going to his long-delayed, long
dreamed-of happiness. True, Katreen was not
pledged to him; he did not even know for
sure if she loved him. He thought, hoped,
dreamed, almost believed that she did; but
then there was her cousin Ian, who had long
wooed her, and to whom old Donald Macarthur
had given his blessing. Nevertheless,
his heart would have been lighter than it had
been for long, but for two things. First, there
was the letter. Some weeks earlier he had
received it, not recognising the writing, because
of the few letters he had ever seen, and, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as it was in a feigned hand. With difficulty
he had deciphered the manuscript, plain
printed though it was. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Well, Sheumais, my brother, it is wondering
if I am dead, you will be. Maybe ay and
maybe no. But I send you this writing to
let you see that I know all you do and think
of. So you are going to leave Eilanmore
without an Achanna upon it? And you will
be going to Sleat in Skye? Well, let me be
telling you this thing. <em>Do not go.</em> I see blood
there. And there is this, too: neither you nor
any man shall take Katreen away from me.
<em>You</em> know that; and Ian Macarthur knows
it; and Katreen knows it: and that holds
whether I am alive or dead. I say to you:
do not go. It will be better for you and for
all. Ian Macarthur is away in the north-sea
with the whaler-captain who came to us at
Eilanmore, and will not be back for three
months yet. It will be better for him not to
come back. But if he comes back he will
have to reckon with the man who says that
Katreen Macarthur is his. I would rather not
have two men to speak to, and one my brother.
It does not matter to you where I am. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
want no money just now. But put aside my
portion for me. Have it ready for me against
the day I call for it. I will not be patient
that day: so have it ready for me. In the
place that I am I am content. You will be
saying: why is my brother away in a remote
place (I will say this to you: that it is not
farther north than St Kilda nor farther south
than the Mull of Cantyre!), and for what
reason? That is between me and silence. But
perhaps you think of Anne sometimes. Do
you know that she lies under the green grass?
And of Mànus MacCodrum? They say that
he swam out into the sea and was drowned;
and they whisper of the seal-blood, though the
minister is wroth with them for that. He calls
it a madness. Well, I was there at that madness,
and I played to it on my <i lang="gd">feadan</i>. And
now, Sheumais, can you be thinking of what
the tune was that I played?</p>

<p class="center">“Your brother, who waits his own day,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gloom</span>.”</p>

<p>“Do not be forgetting this thing: <em>I would
rather not be playing the ‘Damhsà-na-mairbh.’</em>
It was an ill hour for Mànus when he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the Dàn-nan-Ròn; it was the song of his
soul, that; and yours is the Davsa-na-Mairv.”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter was ever in his mind: this,
and what happened in the gloaming when
he sailed away for Skye in the herring-smack
of two men who lived at Armadale
in Sleat. For, as the boat moved slowly out
of the haven, one of the men asked him if
he was sure that no one was left upon the
island; for he thought he had seen a figure
on the rocks, waving a black scarf. Achanna
shook his head, but just then his companion
cried that at that moment he had seen the
same thing. So the smack was put about,
and when she was moving slow through the
haven again, Achanna sculled ashore in the little
coggly punt. In vain he searched here and
there, calling loudly again and again. Both
men could hardly have been mistaken, he
thought. If there were no human creature
on the island, and if their eyes had not played
them false, who could it be? The wraith of
Marcus, mayhap; or might it be the old man
himself (his father), risen to bid farewell to
his youngest son, or to warn him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no use to wait longer; so, looking
often behind him, he made his way to the
boat again, and rowed slowly out towards
the smack.</p>

<p><em>Jerk</em>&mdash;<em>jerk</em>&mdash;<em>jerk</em> across the water came, low
but only too loud for him, the opening bars
of the Damhsa-na-Mairbh. A horror came
upon him, and he drove the boat through
the water so that the sea splashed over the
bows. When he came on deck he cried in
a hoarse voice to the man next him to put
up the helm, and let the smack swing to the
wind.</p>

<p>“There is no one there, Callum Campbell,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“And who is it that will be making that
strange music?”</p>

<p>“What music?”</p>

<p>“Sure, it has stopped now, but I heard it
clear, and so did Anndra MacEwan. It was
like the sound of a reed-pipe, and the tune
was an eerie one at that.”</p>

<p>“It was the Dance of the Dead.”</p>

<p>“And who will be playing that?” asked
the man, with fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No living man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“No living man?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m thinking it will be one of my
brothers who was drowned here, and by the
same token that it is Gloom, for he played
upon the <i lang="gd">feadan</i>; but if not, then …
then …”</p>

<p>The two men waited in breathless silence,
each trembling with superstitious fear; but at
last the elder made a sign to Achanna to finish.</p>

<p>“Then … it will be the Kelpie.”</p>

<p>“Is there … is there one of the …
the cave-women here?”</p>

<p>“It is said; and you know of old that the
Kelpie sings or plays a strange tune to wile
seamen to their death.”</p>

<p>At that moment, the fantastic jerking music
came loud and clear across the bay. There
was a horrible suggestion in it, as if dead
bodies were moving along the ground with
long jerks, and crying and laughing wild. It
was enough; the men, Campbell and MacEwan,
would not now have waited longer if Achanna
had offered them all he had in the world.
Nor were they, or he, out of their panic haste
till the smack stood well out at sea, and not
a sound could be heard from Eilanmore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>They stood watching, silent. Out of the
dusky mass that lay in the seaward way to
the north came a red gleam. It was like an
eye staring after them with blood-red glances.</p>

<p>“What is that, Achanna?” asked one of the
men at last.</p>

<p>“It looks as though a fire had been lit
in the house up in the island. The door
and the window must be open. The fire
must be fed with wood, for no peats would
give that flame; and there were none lit
when I left. To my knowing, there was no
wood for burning except the wood of the
shelves and the bed.”</p>

<p>“And who would be doing that?”</p>

<p>“I know of that no more than you do,
Callum Campbell.”</p>

<p>No more was said, and it was a relief to
all when the last glimmer of the light was
absorbed in the darkness.</p>

<p>At the end of the voyage Campbell and
MacEwan were well pleased to be quit of
their companion; not so much because he
was moody and distraught, as because they
feared that a spell was upon him&mdash;a fate in
the working of which they might become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
involved. It needed no vow of the one to
the other for them to come to the conclusion
that they would never land on Eilanmore, or, if
need be, only in broad daylight, and never alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The days went well for James Achanna,
where he made his home at Ranza-beag, on
Ranza Water in the Sleat of Skye. The
farm was small but good, and he hoped
that with help and care he would soon
have the place as good a farm as there
was in all Skye.</p>

<p>Donald Macarthur did not let him see
much of Katreen, but the old man was no
longer opposed to him. Sheumais must wait
till Ian Macarthur came back again, which
might be any day now. For sure, James
Achanna of Ranza-beag was a very different
person from the youngest of the Achanna-folk
who held by on lonely Eilanmore;
moreover, the old man could not but think
with pleasure that it would be well to see
Katreen able to walk over the whole land
of Ranza, from the cairn at the north of his
own Ranza-Mòr to the burn at the south of
Ranza-beag, and know it for her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>But Achanna was ready to wait. Even
before he had the secret word of Katreen he
knew from her beautiful dark eyes that she
loved him. As the weeks went by they
managed to meet often, and at last Katreen
told him that she loved him too, and would
have none but him; but that they must wait
till Ian came back, because of the pledge
given to him by her father. They were days
of joy for him. Through many a hot noon-tide
hour, through many a gloaming, he went
as one in a dream. Whenever he saw a
birch swaying in the wind, or a wave leaping
upon Loch Liath, that was near his home, or
passed a bush covered with wild roses, or saw
the moonbeams lying white on the boles of
the pines, he thought of Katreen: his fawn
for grace, and so lithe and tall, with sun-brown
face and wavy dark mass of hair and
shadowy eyes and rowan-red lips. It is said
that there is a god clothed in shadow who
goes to and fro among the human kind,
putting silence between lovers with his waving
hands, and breathing a chill out of his cold
breath, and leaving a gulf of deep water flowing
between them because of the passing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his feet. That shadow never came their way.
Their love grew as a flower fed by rains and
warmed by sunlight.</p>

<p>When midsummer came, and there was no
sign of Ian Macarthur, it was already too late.
Katreen had been won.</p>

<p>During the summer months, it was the
custom for Katreen and two of the farm girls
to go up Maol-Ranza, to reside at the
shealing of Cnoc-an-Fhraoch: and this because
of the hill-pasture for the sheep. Cnoc-an-Fhraoch
is a round, boulder-studded hill
covered with heather, which has a precipitous
corrie on each side, and in front slopes down
to Lochan Fraoch, a lochlet surrounded by
dark woods. Behind the hill, or great hillock
rather, lay the shealing. At each week-end
Katreen went down to Ranza-Mòr, and on
every Monday morning at sunrise returned to
her heather-girt eyrie. It was on one of
these visits that she endured a cruel shock.
Her father told her that she must marry
some one else than Sheumais Achanna. He
had heard words about him which made a
union impossible, and, indeed, he hoped that
the man would leave Ranza-beag. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
end, he admitted that what he had heard
was to the effect that Achanna was under a
doom of some kind; that he was involved in
a blood feud; and, moreover, that he was fëy.
The old man would not be explicit as to the
person from whom his information came, but
hinted that he was a stranger of rank, probably
a laird of the isles. Besides this, there
was word of Ian Macarthur. He was at
Thurso, in the far north, and would be in
Skye before long, and he&mdash;her father&mdash;had
written to him that he might wed Katreen as
soon as was practicable.</p>

<p>“Do you see that lintie yonder, father?”
was her response to this.</p>

<p>“Ay, lass; and what about the birdeen?”</p>

<p>“Well, when she mates with a hawk, so
will I be mating with Ian Macarthur, but not
till then.”</p>

<p>With that she turned, and left the house,
and went back to Cnoc-an-Fhraoch. On the
way she met Achanna.</p>

<p>It was that night that, for the first time,
he swam across Lochan Fraoch to meet
Katreen.</p>

<p>The quickest way to reach the shealing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to row across the lochlet, and then ascend by
a sheep-path that wound through the hazel
copses at the base of the hill. Fully half-an-hour
was thus saved, because of the steepness
of the precipitous corries to right and left.
A boat was kept for this purpose, but it was
fastened to a shore-boulder by a padlocked
iron chain, the key of which was kept by
Donald Macarthur. Latterly he had refused
to let this key out of his possession. For one
thing, no doubt, he believed he could thus
restrain Achanna from visiting his daughter.
The young man could not approach the
shealing from either side without being seen.</p>

<p>But that night, soon after the moon was
whitening slow in the dark, Katreen stole
down to the hazel copse and awaited the
coming of her lover. The lochan was visible
from almost any point on Cnoc-an-Fhraoch,
as well as from the south side. To cross it
in a boat unseen, if any watcher were near,
would be impossible, nor could even a swimmer
hope to escape notice unless in the gloom of
night, or, mayhap, in the dusk. When, however,
she saw, half way across the water, a
spray of green branches slowly moving athwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the surface, she knew that Sheumais was keeping
his tryst. If, perchance, any one else saw,
he or she would never guess that those derelict
rowan-branches shrouded Sheumais Achanna.</p>

<p>It was not till the estray had drifted close
to the ledge, where, hid among the bracken
and the hazel undergrowth, she awaited him,
that Katreen descried the face of her lover,
as with one hand he parted the green sprays
and stared longingly and lovingly at the figure
he could just discern in the dim fragrant
obscurity.</p>

<p>And as it was this night, so was it on many
of the nights that followed. Katreen spent
the days as in a dream. Not even the news
of her cousin Ian’s return disturbed her
much.</p>

<p>One day the inevitable meeting came. She
was at Ranza-Mòr, and when a shadow came
into the dairy where she was standing she
looked up, and saw Ian before her. She
thought he appeared taller and stronger than
ever, though still not so tall as Sheumais, who
would appear slim beside the Herculean Skye
man. But as she looked at his close curling
black hair, and thick bull neck, and the sullen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
eyes in his dark wind-red face, she wondered
that she had ever tolerated him at all.</p>

<p>He broke the ice at once.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Katreen, are you glad to see me
back again?”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are home once more
safe and sound.”</p>

<p>“And will you make it my home for me by
coming to live with me, as I’ve asked you
again and again.”</p>

<p>“No, as I’ve told you again and again.”</p>

<p>He gloomed at her angrily for a few moments
before he resumed.</p>

<p>“I will be asking you this one thing, Katreen,
daughter of my father’s brother: do you
love that man Achanna who lives at Ranza-beag?”</p>

<p>“You may ask the wind why it is from the
east or the west, but it won’t tell you. You’re
not the wind’s master.”</p>

<p>“If you think I will let this man take you
away from me, you are thinking a foolish
thing.”</p>

<p>“And you saying a foolisher.”</p>

<p>“Ay?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sure. What could you do, Ian-mhic-Ian?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
At the worst, you could do no more
than kill James Achanna. What then? I
too would die. You cannot separate us. I
would not marry you, now, though you were the
last man on the world and I the last woman.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool, Katreen Macarthur. Your
father has promised you to me, and I tell you
this: if you love Achanna you’ll save his
life only by letting him go away from here.
I promise you he will not be here long.”</p>

<p>“Ay, you promise <em>me</em>; but you will not
say that thing to James Achanna’s face. You
are a coward.”</p>

<p>With a muttered oath the man turned on
his heel.</p>

<p>“Let him beware o’ me, and you, too,
Katreen-mo-nighean-donn. I swear it by my
mother’s grave and by St Martin’s Cross that
you will be mine by hook or by crook.”</p>

<p>The girl smiled scornfully. Slowly she
lifted a milk-pail.</p>

<p>“It would be a pity to waste the good
milk, Ian-gòrach; but if you don’t go it is
I that will be emptying the pail on you, and
then you’ll be as white without as your heart
is within.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“So, you call me witless, do you? <i lang="gd">Ian-gòrach!</i>
Well, we shall be seeing as to that; and as for
the milk, there will be more than milk spilt
because of <em>you</em>, Katreen-donn.”</p>

<p>From that day, though neither Sheumais nor
Katreen knew of it, a watch was set upon
Achanna.</p>

<p>It could not be long before their secret was
discovered; and it was with a savage joy overmastering
his sullen rage that Ian Macarthur
knew himself the discoverer, and conceived
his double vengeance. He dreamed, gloatingly,
on both the black thoughts that roamed like
ravenous beasts through the solitudes of his
heart. But he did not dream that another
man was filled with hate because of Katreen’s
lover&mdash;another man who had sworn to make
her his own; the man who, disguised, was
known in Armadale as Donald McLean, and
in the north isles would have been hailed as
Gloom Achanna.</p>

<p>There had been steady rain for three days,
with a cold raw wind. On the fourth the
sun shone, and set in peace. An evening of
quiet beauty followed, warm, fragrant, dusky
from the absence of moon or star, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thin veils of mist promised to disperse as
the night grew.</p>

<p>There were two men that eve in the undergrowth
on the south side of the lochlet. Sheumais
had come earlier than his wont. Impatient
for the dusk, he could scarce await the waning
of the afterglow. Surely, he thought, he might
venture. Suddenly his ears caught the sound
of cautious footsteps. Could it be old Donald,
perhaps, with some inkling of the way in
which his daughter saw her lover, in despite of
all; or, mayhap, might it be Ian Macarthur
tracking him, as a hunter stalking a stag by
the water-pools? He crouched, and waited. In
a few minutes he saw Ian carefully picking
his way. The man stooped as he descried
the green branches; smiled as, with a low
rustling, he raised them from the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, yet another man watched and
waited, though on the farther side of the
lochan, where the hazel copses were. Gloom
Achanna half hoped, half feared the approach
of Katreen. It would be sweet to see her
again, sweet to slay her lover before her
eyes, brother to him though he was. But,
there was the chance that she might descry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
him, and, whether recognisingly or not, warn
the swimmer. So it was that he had come
there before sundown, and now lay crouched
among the bracken underneath a projecting
mossy ledge close upon the water, where it
could scarce be that she or any should see
him.</p>

<p>As the gloaming deepened, a great stillness
reigned. There was no breath of wind.
A scarce audible sigh prevailed among the
spires of the heather. The churring of a nightjar
throbbed through the darkness. Somewhere
a corncrake called its monotonous
<i>crék-craik</i>&mdash;the dull harsh sound emphasising
the utter stillness. The pinging of the gnats
hovering over and among the sedges made
an incessant rumour through the warm sultry
air.</p>

<p>There was a splash once as of a fish; then
silence. Then a lower but more continuous
splash, or rather wash of water. A slow
susurrus rustled through the dark.</p>

<p>Where he lay among the fern Gloom
Achanna slowly raised his head, stared through
the shadows, and listened intently. If Katreen
were waiting there she was not near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Noiselessly he slid into the water. When
he rose it was under a clump of green branches.
These he had cut and secured three hours
before. With his left hand he swam slowly,
or kept his equipoise in the water; with his
right he guided the heavy rowan bough. In
his mouth were two objects, one long and
thin and dark, the other with an occasional
glitter as of a dead fish.</p>

<p>His motion was scarce perceptible. None the
less he was nigh the middle of the loch almost
as soon the other clump of green branches.
Doubtless the swimmer beneath it was confident
that he was now safe from observation.</p>

<p>The two clumps of green branches drew
nearer. The smaller seemed a mere estray&mdash;a
spray blown down by the recent gale. But
all at once the larger clump jerked awkwardly
and stopped. Simultaneously a strange low
strain of music came from the other.</p>

<p>The strain ceased. The two clumps of green
branches remained motionless. Slowly at last
the larger moved forward. It was too dark
for the swimmer to see if any one lay hid
behind the smaller. When he reached it he
thrust aside the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as though a great salmon leaped.
There was a splash, and a narrow dark body
shot through the gloom. At the end of it
something gleamed. Then suddenly there
was a savage struggle. The inanimate green
branches tore this way and that, and surged
and swirled. Gasping cries came from the
leaves. Again and again the gleaming thing
leaped. At the third leap an awful scream
shrilled through the silence. The echo of it
wailed thrice with horrible distinctness in the
corrie beyond Cnoc-an-Fhraoch. Then, after a
faint splashing, there was silence once more.
One clump of green branches drifted loosely up
the lochlet. The other moved steadily towards
the place whence, a brief while before, it had
stirred.</p>

<p>Only one thing lived in the heart of Gloom
Achanna&mdash;the joy of his exultation. He had
killed his brother Sheumais. He had always
hated him because of his beauty; of late he
had hated him because he had stood between
him, Gloom, and Katreen Macarthur, because
he had become her lover. They were all
dead now except himself&mdash;all the Achannas.
He was “Achanna.” When the day came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
that he would go back to Galloway there
would be a magpie on the first birk, and a
screaming jay on the first rowan, and a croaking
raven on the first fir. Ay, he would be
their suffering, though they knew nothing of
him meanwhile! He would be Achanna of
Achanna again. Let those who would stand
in his way beware. As for Katreen: perhaps
he would take her there, perhaps not. He
smiled.</p>

<p>These thoughts were the wandering fires in
his brain while he slowly swam shoreward
under the floating green branches, and as he
disengaged himself from them, and crawled
upward through the bracken. It was at this
moment that a third man entered the water
from the farther shore.</p>

<p>Prepared as he was to come suddenly
upon Katreen, Gloom was startled when, in
a place of dense shadow, a hand touched his
shoulder, and her voice whispered, “<i lang="gd">Sheumais,
Sheumais!</i>”</p>

<p>The next moment she was in his arms. He
could feel her heart beating against his side.</p>

<p>“What was it, Sheumais? What was that
awful cry?” she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>For answer he put his lips to hers, and
kissed her again and again.</p>

<p>The girl drew back. Some vague instinct
warned her.</p>

<p>“What is it, Sheumais? Why don’t you
speak?”</p>

<p>He drew her close again.</p>

<p>“Pulse of my heart, it is I who love you&mdash;I
who love you best of all. It is I, Gloom
Achanna!”</p>

<p>With a cry, she struck him full in the face.
He staggered, and in that moment she freed
herself.</p>

<p>“You <em>coward</em>!”</p>

<p>“Katreen, I …”</p>

<p>“Come no nearer. If you do, it will be the
death of you!”</p>

<p>“The death o’ me! Ah, bonnie fool that
you are, and is it you that will be the death
o’ me?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Gloom Achanna, for I have but to
scream and Sheumais will be here, an’ he
would kill you like a dog if he knew you
did me harm.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but if there were no James, or any
man, to come between me an’ my will!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then there would be a woman! Ay, if
you overbore me I would strangle you with
my hair, or fix my teeth in your false throat!”</p>

<p>“I was not for knowing you were such a
wild-cat! But I’ll tame you yet, my lass!
Aha, wild-cat!” and, as he spoke, he laughed
low.</p>

<p>“It is a true word, Gloom of the black
heart. I <em>am</em> a wild-cat, and like a wild-cat I
am not to be seized by a fox, and that you
will be finding to your cost, by the holy
St Bridget! But now, off with you, brother
of my man!”</p>

<p>“Your man … ha! ha!…”</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I am laughing at a warm white lass
like yourself having a dead man as your
lover!”</p>

<p>“A … dead … man?”</p>

<p>No answer came. The girl shook with a
new fear. Slowly she drew closer till her
breath fell warm against the face of the
other. He spoke at last.</p>

<p>“Ay, a dead man.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie.”</p>

<p>“Where would you be that you were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hearing his goodbye? I’m thinking it was
loud enough!”</p>

<p>“It is a lie … it is a lie!”</p>

<p>“No, it is no lie. Sheumais is cold enough
now. He’s low among the weeds by now.
Ay, by now; down there in the lochan.”</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> … you, <em>you devil</em>! Is it for
killing your own brother you would be!”</p>

<p>“I killed no one. He died his own way.
Maybe the cramp took him. Maybe …
maybe a kelpie gripped him. I watched. I
saw him beneath the green branches. He
was dead before he died, I saw it in the
white face o’ him. Then he sank. He’s
dead&mdash;James is dead. Look here, girl, I’ve
always loved you. I swore the oath upon
you&mdash;you’re mine. Sure, you’re mine now,
Katreen! It is loving you I am! It will
be a south wind for you from this day, <i lang="gd">muirnean
mochree</i>! See here, I’ll show you how
I …”</p>

<p>“Back … back … <em>murderer</em>!”</p>

<p>“Be stopping that foolishness now, Katreen
Macarthur! By the Book, I am tired of it!
I am loving you, and it’s having you for
mine I am! And if you won’t come to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
like the dove to its mate, I’ll come to you
like the hawk to the dove!”</p>

<p>With a spring he was upon her. In vain
she strove to beat him back. His arms held
her as a stoat grips a rabbit.</p>

<p>He pulled her head back, and kissed her
throat till the strangulating breath sobbed
against his ear. With a last despairing effort
she screamed the name of the dead man&mdash;“<em>Sheumais!
Sheumais! Sheumais!</em>” The man
who struggled with her laughed.</p>

<p>“Ay, call away! The herrin’ will be coming
through the bracken as soon as Sheumais
comes to your call! Ah, it is mine you are
now, Katreen! He’s dead an’ cold, …
an’ you’d best have a living man … an’ …”</p>

<p>She fell back, her balance lost in the sudden
releasing. What did it mean? Gloom still
stood there, but as one frozen. Through the
darkness she saw at last that a hand gripped
his shoulder&mdash;behind him a black mass vaguely
obtruded.</p>

<p>For some moments there was absolute
silence. Then a hoarse voice came out of
the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will be knowing now who it is,
Gloom Achanna!”</p>

<p>The voice was that of Sheumais, who lay
dead in the lochan. The murderer shook as
in a palsy. With a great effort, slowly he
turned his head. He saw a white splatch&mdash;the
face of the corpse. In this white splatch
flamed two burning eyes, the eyes of the soul
of the brother whom he had slain.</p>

<p>He reeled, staggered as a blind man, and,
free now of that awful clasp, swayed to and
fro as one drunken.</p>

<p>Slowly Sheumais raised an arm, and pointed
downward through the wood towards the
lochan. Still pointing, he moved swiftly
forward. With a cry like a beast, Gloom
Achanna swung to one side, stumbled, rose,
and leaped into the darkness.</p>

<p>For some minutes Sheumais and Katreen
stood, silent, apart, listening to the crashing
sound of his flight&mdash;the race of the murderer
against the pursuing shadow of the Grave.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ARCHER" class="italic">THE ARCHER</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ARCHER</h3>

<p>The man who told me this thing was Coll
McColl, an islander of Barra, in the Southern
Hebrides. He spoke in the Gaelic, and it was
while he was mending his net; and by the
same token I thought at the time that his
words were like herring-fry in that net, some
going clean through, and others sticking fast
by the gills. So I do not give it exactly as I
heard it, but in substance as Coll gave it.</p>

<p>He is dead now, and has perhaps seen the
Archer. Coll was a poet, and the island-folk
said he was mad: but this was only because
he loved beyond the reach of his fate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were two men who loved one woman.
It is of no mere girl with the fair looks upon
her I am speaking, but of a woman, that can
put the spell over two men. The name of the
woman was Silis: the names of the men were
Sheumas and Isla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Silis was the wife of Sheumas. So Sheumas
had his home, for her breast was his pillow
when he willed it: and he had her voice for
daily music: and his eyes had never any thirst,
for they could drink of her beauty by day and
by night. But Isla had no home. He saw
his home afar off, and his joy and his strength
failed, because the shining lights of it were
not for him.</p>

<p>One night the two men were upon the water.
It was a dead calm, and the nets had been laid.
There was no moon at all, and only a star or
two up in the black corner of the sky. The
sea had the wandering flames in it: and when
the big jellyfish floated by, they were like the
tide-lamps that some are for saying the dead
bear on their drowned faces.</p>

<p>“Some day I may be telling you a strange
thing, Sheumas,” said Isla, after the long silence
there had been since the last net had sent a
little cloud of sparkles up from the gulfs.</p>

<p>“Ay?” said Sheumas, taking his pipe from
his mouth, and looking at the spire of smoke
rising just forward o’ the mast. The water
slipped by, soft and slow. It was only the
tide feeling its way up the sea-loch, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was not a breath of wind. Here and there
were dusky shadows: the boats of the fishermen
of Inchghunnais. Each carried a red
light, and in some were green lanterns slung
midway up the mast.</p>

<p>No other word was said for a long time.</p>

<p>“And I’m wondering,” said Isla at last:
“I’m wondering what you’ll think of that
story.”</p>

<p>Sheumas made no answer to that. He
smoked, and stared down into the dark water.</p>

<p>After a time he rose, and leaned against
the mast. Though there was no light of either
moon or lamp, he put his hand above his eyes,
as his wont was.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking the mackerel will be coming
this way to-night. This is the third time I’ve
heard the snoring of the pollack … away
yonder, beyond Peter Macallum’s boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sheumas, I’ll sleep a bit. I had
only the outside of a sleep last night.”</p>

<p>With that Isla knocked the ash out of his
pipe, and lay over against a pile of rope, and
shut his eyes, and did not sleep at all because of
the sick dull pain of the homeless man he was&mdash;home,
home, home, and Silis the name of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>When, an hour or more later, he grew stiff
he moved, and opened his eyes. His mate
was sitting at the helm, but the light in his
pipe was out, though he held the pipe in
his mouth, and his eyes were wide staring
open.</p>

<p>“I would not be telling me that story, Isla,”
he said.</p>

<p>Isla answered nothing, but shifted back to
where he was before, for all his cramped leg.
He closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>At the full of the tide, in the deep dark
hour before the false dawn, as the first
glimmer is called, the glimmer that comes
and goes, both men got up, and moved about,
stamping their feet. Each lit his pipe, and
the smoke hung long in little greyish puffs,
so dead-still was it.</p>

<p>On the <i>Brudhearg</i>, John Macalpine’s boat,
young Neil Macalpine sang. The two men
on the <i>Luath</i> could hear his singing. It was
one of the strange songs of Ian Mòr.</p>

<p>Sheumas leaned against the tiller of the
<i>Luath</i>, and looked at Isla. He saw a shadow
on his face. With his right foot the man
tapped against a loose spar that was on the
starboard deck.</p>

<p>When the singer ceased, Isla raised his arm
and shook menacingly his clenched fist, over
across the water to where the <i>Brudhearg</i> lay.</p>

<p>There were words on his lips, but they died
away when Neil Macalpine broke into a love
song, “Mo nighean donn.”</p>

<p>“Can you be telling me, Isla,” said Sheumas,
“who was the man that made that song about
the homeless man?”</p>

<p>“Ian Mòr.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ian Mòr of the Hills?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“They say he had the shadow upon
him?”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p>“Was it because of love?”</p>

<p>“It was because of love.”</p>

<p>“Did the woman love him?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Did she go to him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was that why he had the mind-dark?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“But he loved her, and she loved him?”</p>

<p>“He loved her, and she loved him.”</p>

<p>For a time Sheumas kept silence. Then he
spoke again.</p>

<p>“She was the wife of another man?”</p>

<p>“Ay; she was the wife of another man.”</p>

<p>“Did <em>he</em> love her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for sure.”</p>

<p>“Did <em>she</em> love <em>him</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes … yes.”</p>

<p>“Whom, then, did she love? For a woman
can love one man only.”</p>

<p>“She loved both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is not a possible thing: not the one
deep love. It is a lie, Isla Macleod.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a lie, Sheumas Maclean.”</p>

<p>“Which man did she love?”</p>

<p>Isla slowly shook the ash from his pipe,
and looked for a second or two at a momentary
quiver in the sky in the north-east.</p>

<p>“The dawn will be here soon now, Sheumas.”</p>

<p>“Ay. I was asking you, Isla, which man
did she love?”</p>

<p>“Sure she loved the man who gave her the
ring.”</p>

<p>“Which man did she love?”</p>

<p>“O for sure, man, you’re asking me just
like the lawyer who has the trials away at
Balliemore on the mainland yonder.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you that thing myself, Isla
Macleod, if you’ll tell me the name of the
woman.”</p>

<p>“I am not for knowing the name.”</p>

<p>“Was it Mary … or Jessie … or
mayhap was it Silis, now?”</p>

<p>“I am not for knowing the name.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, it might be Silis, then?”</p>

<p>“Ay, for sure it might be Silis. As well
Silis as any other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what would the name of the other
man be?”</p>

<p>“What man?”</p>

<p>“The man whose ring she wore?”</p>

<p>“I am not remembering that name.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, would it be Padruic, or mayhap
Ivor, or … or … perhaps, now,
Sheumas?”</p>

<p>“Ay, it might be that.”</p>

<p>“Sheumas?”</p>

<p>“Ay, as well that as any other.”</p>

<p>“And what was the end?”</p>

<p>“The end o’ what?”</p>

<p>“The end of that loving?”</p>

<p>Isla Macleod gave a low laugh. Then he
stooped to pick up the pipe he had dropped.
Suddenly he rose without touching it. He
put his heel on the warm clay, and crushed
it.</p>

<p>“That is the end of that kind of loving,”
he said. He laughed low again as he said
that.</p>

<p>Sheumas leaned and picked up the trodden
fragments.</p>

<p>“They’re warm still, Macleod.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” Isla cried at that, his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
with a red light coming into the blue: “then
they will go where the man in the song went,
the man who sought his home for ever and
ever and never came any nearer than into the
shine of the window-lamps.”</p>

<p>With that he threw the pieces into the dark
water that was already growing ashy-grey.</p>

<p>“’Tis a sure cure, that, Sheumas Maclean.”</p>

<p>“Ay, so they say, … and so, so: ay,
as you were saying, Ian Mòr went into the
shadow because of that home he could not
win?”</p>

<p>“So they say. And now we’ll take the
nets. ’Tis a heavy net that comes out black,
as the sayin’ is. They’re heavy for sure, after
this still night, an’ the wind southerly, an’ the
pollack this way an’ that.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s strange.”</p>

<p>“What is strange, Sheumas Maclean?”</p>

<p>“That you should say that thing.”</p>

<p>“And for why that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just this. Silis had a dream the other
night, she had. She dreamed she saw you
standing alone on the <i>Luath</i>: and you were
hauling hard a heavy net, so that the sweat
ran down your face. And your face was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
dead-white pale, she said. An’ you hauled
an’ you hauled. An’ someone beside you
that she couldn’t see laughed an’ laughed:
an’ …”</p>

<p>With a stifled oath, Isla broke in upon the
speaker’s words:</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, you said he, the man,
myself it is, was alone on the <i>Luath</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, Silis saw no one but yourself, Isla
Macleod.”</p>

<p>“But she heard some one beside me laughing
an’ laughing.”</p>

<p>“So she said. And you were dead-white,
she said: with the sweat pouring down you.
An’ you pulled an’ you pulled. Then you
looked up at her and said: ‘<i>It’s a heavy net
that comes up black, as the sayin’ is.</i>’”</p>

<p>Isla Macleod made no answer to that, but
slowly began to haul at the nets. A swift
moving light slid hither and thither well away
to the north-east. The sea greyed. A new,
poignant, salt smell came up from the waves.
Sail after sail of the smacks ceased to be a
blur in the dark: each lifted a brown shadowy
wing against a dusk through which a flood
of myriad drops of light steadily oozed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Now from this boat, now from that, hoarse
cries resounded.</p>

<p>The <i>Mairi Ban</i> swung slowly round before
the faint dawn-wind, and lifted her bow
homeward with a little slapping splash. The
<i>Maggie</i>, the <i>Trilleachan</i>, the <i>Eilid</i>, the <i>Jessie</i>,
and the <i>Mairi Donn</i> followed one by one.</p>

<p>In silence the two men on the <i>Luath</i>
hauled in their nets. The herring made a
sheet of shifting silver as they lay in the
hold. As the dawn lightened, the quivering
silver mass sparkled. The decks were mailed
with glittering scales: these, too, gleamed upon
the legs, arms, and hands of the two fishermen.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s done!” exclaimed Sheumas at
last. “Up with the helm, Isla, and let us
make for home.”</p>

<p>The <i>Luath</i> forged ahead rapidly when once
the sail had its bellyful of wind. She passed
the <i>Tern</i>, then the <i>Jessie Macalpine</i>, caught up
the big, lumbering <i>Maggie</i>, and went rippling
and rushing along the wake of the <i>Eilid</i>, the
lightest of the Inchghunnais boats.</p>

<p>Off shore, the steamer <i>Osprey</i> met the
smacks, and took the herring away, cran by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
cran. Long before her screw made a yeast of
foam athwart the black-green inshore water,
the <i>Luath</i> was in the little haven and had
her nose in the shingle at Craigard point.</p>

<p>In silence Sheumas and Isla walked by the
rock-path to the isolated cottage where the
Macleans lived. The swallows were flitting
hither and thither in front of its low, whitewashed
wall, like flying shuttles against a
silent loom. The pale gold of a rainy dawn
lit the whiteness with a vivid gleam. Suddenly
Isla stopped.</p>

<p>“Will you be telling me now, Sheumas,
which man it was that she loved?”</p>

<p>Maclean did not look at the speaker, though
he stopped too. He stared at the white
cottage, and at the little square window with
the geranium-pot on the lintel.</p>

<p>But while he hesitated, Isla Macleod turned
away, and walked swiftly across the wet
bracken and bog-myrtle till he disappeared
over Cnoc-na-Hurich, on the hidden slope of
which his own cottage stood amid a wilderness
of whins.</p>

<p>Sheumas watched him till he was out of sight.
It was then only that he answered the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m thinking,” he muttered slowly, “I’m
thinking she loved Ian Mòr.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he muttered again later, as he took
off his sea-soaked clothes, and lay down on
the bed in the kitchen, whence he could see
into the little room where Silis was in a profound
sleep: “Yes, I’m thinking she loved
Ian Mòr.”</p>

<p>He did not sleep at all, for all his weariness.</p>

<p>When the sunlight streamed in across the
red sandstone floor, and crept towards his
wife’s bed, he rose softly and looked at her.
He did not need to stoop when he entered
the room, as Isla Macleod would have had
to do.</p>

<p>He looked at Silis a long time. Her shadowy
hair was all about her face. She had never
seemed to him more beautiful. Well was she
called “Silis the Fawn” in the poem that
some one had made about her.</p>

<p>The poem that some one had made about
her? … yes, for sure, how could he be forgetting
who it was. Was it not Isla, and he
a poet too, another Ian Mòr they said.</p>

<p>“Another Ian Mòr.” As he repeated the
words below his breath, he bent over his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Her white breast rose and fell, the way a
moonbeam does in moving water.</p>

<p>Then he knelt. When he took the slim
white hand in his she did not wake. It
closed lovingly upon his own.</p>

<p>A smile slowly came and went upon the
dreaming face&mdash;ah, lovely, white, dreaming face,
with the hidden starry eyes. There was a
soft flush, and a parting of the lips. The
half-covered bosom rose and fell as with
some groundswell from the beating heart.</p>

<p>“<i>Silis</i>,” he whispered. “<i>Silis</i> … <i>Silis</i> …”</p>

<p>She smiled. He leaned close above her lips.</p>

<p>“Ah, heart o’ me,” she whispered, “O Isla,
Isla, mo rùn, moghray, Isla, Isla, Isla!”</p>

<p>Sheumas drew back. He too was like the
man in her dream, for it was dead-white he
was, with the sweat in great beads upon his
face.</p>

<p>He made no noise as he went back to the
hearthside, and took his wet clothes from where
he had hung them before the smoored peats,
and put them on again.</p>

<p>Then he went out.</p>

<p>It was a long walk to Isla Macleod’s cottage
that few-score yards: a long, long walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>When Sheumas stood on the wet grass round
the flagstones he saw that the door was ajar.
Isla had not lain down. He had taken his
ash-lute, and was alternately playing and singing
low to himself.</p>

<p>Maclean went close up to the wall, and
listened. At first he could hear no more than
snatches of songs.</p>

<p>For some moments there was dead silence.
Then a heavy sigh came from within the
cottage.</p>

<p>Sheumas Maclean at last made a step forward.
But before his shadow fell across the

notes from his <i lang="gd">feadan</i>, and then began a slow

<p>Sheumas’ face was white and tired. It is
weary work with the herring, no doubt.</p>

<p>He lifted a white stone and rapped loudly
on the door. Isla came out, and looked at
him. The singer smiled, though that smiling
had no light in it. It was dark as a dark
wave it was.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>“May I come in?”</p>

<p>“Come in, and welcome. And what will
you be wanting, Sheumas Maclean?”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s too late to sleep, an’ I’m thinking
I would like to hear now that story you
were to tell me.”</p>

<p>The man gave no answer to that. Each
looked at the other with luminous unwinking
eyes.</p>

<p>“It will not be a fair thing,” said Isla slowly,
at last. “It will not be a fair thing: for I
am bigger and stronger.”</p>

<p>“There is another way, Isla Macleod.”</p>

<p>“Ay?”</p>

<p>“That you or I go to her, and tell her
all, and then at the last say: ‘Come with
me, or stay with him.’”</p>

<p>“So be it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>So there and then they drew for chance.
The gaining of that hazard was with Sheumas
Maclean.</p>

<p>Without a word Isla turned and went into
the house. There he took his <i lang="gd">feadan</i>, and
played low to himself, staring into the red
heart of the smouldering peats. He neither
smiled nor frowned; but only once he smiled,
and that was when Sheumas came back, and
said <em>Come</em>.</p>

<p>So the two walked in silence across the
dewy grass. There was a loud calling of skuas
and terns, and the raucous laughing cry of
the great herring-gull, upon the weedy shore
of Craigard. The tide bubbled and oozed
through the wilderness of wrack. Farther off
there were the cackling of hens, the lowing of
restless kye, and the bleating of the sheep on
the slopes of Melmonach. A shrewd salt air
tingled in the nostrils of the two men.</p>

<p>At the closed door Sheumas made a sign
of silence. Then he unfastened the latch,
and entered.</p>

<p>“Silis,” he said in a low voice, but clear.</p>

<p>“Silis, I’ve come back again. Dry your
tears, my lass, and tell me once again&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I’m dying to hear the blessed truth once
again&mdash;tell me once again if it’s me you love
best, or Isla Macleod.”</p>

<p>“I have told you, Sheumas.”</p>

<p>Without, Isla heard her words and drew
closer.</p>

<p>“And it is a true thing that you love me
best, and that since the choice between him
and me has come, you choose me?”</p>

<p>“It is a true thing.”</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the room. Isla Macleod
stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>Silis turned the white beautiful face of her,
and looked at the man she loved with all her
heart and all her soul. He smiled. She was
no coward, his Silis, though he called her his
fawn.</p>

<p>“Is&mdash;it&mdash;a&mdash;true&mdash;thing, Silis?” he asked
slowly.</p>

<p>She looked at Sheumas, then at Isla, then
back at her husband.</p>

<p>“It might kill Sheumas,” she muttered
below her breath, so that neither heard her:
“it might kill him,” she repeated.</p>

<p>Then, with a swift turn of her eyes, she
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is a true thing, Isla. I abide by
Sheumas.”</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>She was conscious of the wave of relief
that went into Sheumas’ face. She saw the
rising of a dark, strange tide in the eyes of
Isla.</p>

<p>He stared at her. Perhaps he did not
hear? Perhaps he was dreaming still? He
was a dreamer, a poet: perhaps he could not
understand.</p>

<p>It was a little while wherein to kill a
man.</p>

<p>“My Fawn,” he whispered hoarsely, “my
wee Fawn!”</p>

<p>But Silis was frozen.</p>

<p>The deadly frost in her eyes slew the
dream that the brain of the poet dreamed.</p>

<p>Then it slew the poet.</p>

<p>Isla, the man, stood awhile, strangely
tremulous. She could see his nerves quivering
below his clothes. He was a big, strong
giant of a lover: but he trembled now just
like a bit fawn, she thought. His blue eyes
were suddenly grown cloudy and dim. Then
the deadly frost slew the brain that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
altar where the poet offered up his dreams
of beauty.</p>

<p>And that is how Isla the dreamer ceased
to dream.</p>

<p>He was quite white and still when they
found him three days later. He seemed a
giant of a man as he lay, face upward, among
the green flags by the water-edge. The chill
starlight of three nights had got into the quiet
of his face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night, resumed Coll McColl, after a
long pause&mdash;that night he, Coll, was walking
in the moonlight across the hither slope of
Melmonach.</p>

<p>He stood under a rowan-tree, and watched
a fawn leaping wildly through the fern. While
he watched, amazed, he saw a tall shadowy
woman pass by. She stopped, and drew a
great bow she carried, and shot an arrow. It
went through the air with a sharp whistling
sound&mdash;just like <em>Silis&mdash;Silis&mdash;Silis</em>, Coll said,
to give me an idea of it.</p>

<p>The arrow went right through the fawn.</p>

<p>But here was a strange thing. The fawn
leapt away sobbing into the night: while its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
heart suspended, arrow-pierced, from the white
stem of a silver birch.</p>

<p>“And to this day,” said Coll at the last,
“I am not for knowing who that archer was,
or who that fawn. You think it was these
two who loved? Well, ’tis Himself knows.
But I have this thought of my thinking: that
it was only a vision I saw, and that the fawn
was the poor suffering heart of Love, and that
the Archer was the great Shadowy Archer
that hunts among the stars. For in the dark
of the morrow after that night I was on Cnoc-na-Hurich,
and I saw a woman there shooting
arrow after arrow against the stars. At dawn
she rose and passed away, like smoke, beyond
those pale wandering fires.”</p>

<p>“<i>Not beauty alone, but that element of strangeness in beauty
which Mr Pater rightly discerned as the inmost spirit of
romantic art&mdash;it is this which gives to Miss Macleod’s work
its peculiar æsthetic charm. But apart from and beyond all
those qualities which one calls artistic, there is a poignant
human cry, as of a voice with tears in it, speaking from out
a gloaming which never lightens to day, which will compel
and hold the hearing of many who to the claims of art as such
are wholly or largely unresponsive.</i>” (<span class="smcap">James Ashcroft
Noble</span>, in <span class="smcap">The New Age</span>.)</p>

<p>“<i>Of the products of what has been called the Celtic Renascence</i>,
‘The Sin-Eater’ <i>and its companion Stories seem to us
the most remarkable. They are of imagination and a certain
terrible beauty all compact.</i>” (From an article in <span class="smcap">The Daily
Chronicle</span> on “The Gaelic Glamour.”)</p>

<p>“<i>For sheer originality, other qualities apart, her tales are as
remarkable, perhaps, as anything we have had of the kind
since Mr Kipling appeared … Their local colour, their
idiom, their whole method, combine to produce an effect which
may be unaccustomed, but is therefore the more irresistible. They
provide as original an entertainment as we are likely to find in
this lingering century, and they suggest a new romance among
the potential things of the century to come.</i>” (<span class="smcap">The Academy.</span>)</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
